THE MAN WHO WON
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
LUTWYCHE'S
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Handsome, were you?  'Tis more than they held,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than they said.  I was ware, and watched.<br>
  I was the scapegrace, this rat belled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat, this fool got his whiskers scratched."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ROBERT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The talk had waxed political, and the audience was
frankly bored.  The man who had been haranguing his
mates was hurt at the somewhat too obvious lack of
appreciation which his truly democratic sentiments
received.
</p>

<p>
"Ef yer could quit twinin' yerself araound that thar'
post a spell, an' listen to a bit o' horse-sense"&mdash;he broke
off angrily.
</p>

<p>
"It's usually hoarse when you take the floor,
Amurrica," was the surly reply; "but it's blasted
little sense I've ever heard come outer your head."
</p>

<p>
"Ef you was to listen, it 'ud make a powerful deal o'
difference to what you heard," snapped Amurrica, whose
eloquence was his chief vanity.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't good at listening," indifferently replied the
blond and bearded giant, who was "twinin' hisself
araound the post," "onless a man's talkin'; an' that's
a fact."
</p>

<p>
There was a giggle of appreciation among the half-dozen
men and youths collected at the gate of the farm
enclosure.
</p>

<p>
"No good, Amurrica; chuck it!  Bert'll git there
every time," said someone cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Amurrica snorted.
</p>

<p>
"Talkin', indeed!  Why, you low-downers in this all-fired
continent of Africa, you don' know what talkin'
means!"
</p>

<p>
"Usually means lyin' over in America, don't it?"
said Bert casually.
</p>

<p>
His eyes were fixed on vacancy as he spoke; the
chatter of the group around him was nothing but a
weariness, like the buzzing of flies.  His mind was fixed
upon what was going on in the low frame house, with
the corrugated iron roof, that stood within the enclosure.
He was experiencing something more like anxiety than
he had ever felt before in all his four-and-twenty years.
</p>

<p>
It was oppressively hot.  For miles and miles, the
pitiless sun lit up the endless veldt, which undulated
all around the little township: wild, yet with a dreadful
sameness in it.
</p>

<p>
"As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall
be," seemed written upon the face of the desert; yet
here and there its dignity was scarred, its monotony
interfered with, by the ugliness and meanness of human
habitation.  The beginnings of civilisation, without
simplicity as they were without harmony, jarred every
sense.  The places seemed to be devoid of self-respect
or privacy; to consist, in fact, entirely of back premises.
Rows of dingy linen flapped upon lines, on ground
where the grass was irregularly worn away here and
there by the treading of feet.  Collections of old meat
tins, old kettles, old shoes, heaped upon kitchen refuse,
burdened the stale air with miasma.  A wretched-looking,
lean-to building bore a huge board with the
flaunting inscription:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  MOUNT PLEASANT BOARDING-HOUSE FOR<br>
  GENTLEMEN<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The gentlemen who boarded there were mostly
assembled to-night at the gate of "Lutwyche's."
</p>

<p>
A little farther away the Vierkleur Hotel fluttered its
flag in the heavy air, and rang at night to the coarse
laughter and oaths of a set of idlers, attracted to what
had been a purely agricultural district by the finding of
diamonds.
</p>

<p>
Lutwyche's lay silent, sweltering in the heat.  Round
the stoep of the farm-house hungry poultry were
congregated; to-day they were being neglected, and they were
wisely determined not to suffer in silence.
</p>

<p>
It was a critical moment in history.  All Europe was
waiting to know what President Kruger was going to
do.  It was the period which preceded the sending of his
historical ultimatum.  The town for days had been
buzzing with rumours of war, and Amurrica had
spoken great things in the saloon of the Vierkleur.
But local interests are strong, and it was not of British
supremacy that the men were thinking now.
</p>

<p>
The sun was going down.  They had all, as Amurrica
said, quit work, and they were assembled by the barbed
wire fence to gather news of the Englishman who lay
dying under the corrugated iron roof of Lutwyche's.
</p>

<p>
Even the quarrelling was listless.  It could be seen
that Bert's heart was not in it.  Where the heart of the
huge young Boer was was matter of pretty common
knowledge, though there was not a man in the settlement
who would have dared to tell him so, except
Amurrica, who had his own reasons for not indulging
in the perilous amusement.
</p>

<p>
Presently the door of the silent house opened, and a
Kaffir girl came out, with a dirty rug in her hand, from
which she proceeded to shake clouds of stifling acrid
dust.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Minnie, Topsy, Hattie, whoever you are,
how's the boss&mdash;eh?" called one of the loungers.
</p>

<p>
The girl showed all her teeth in an apparently endless
grin.
</p>

<p>
"You young gentlemen carled to inquire?" she cried,
in high appreciation of the family importance.  "You
brought yo' visitin'-cards&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Shut it," said Bert savagely.  "How is Mr. Lutwyche?"
</p>

<p>
"He don' seem not just the right thing to-day, sir,
with missus's compulments," grinned the girl, wildly
elated by her momentary distinction.
</p>

<p>
To her intense delight, this last sally caused a giggle
among the loafers.  She edged nearer to the barbed
wire fencing, to prolong this truly delightful conversation;
and for a minute or two, idiotic questions and answers
pattered across the farm boundary, while Bert's brow
grew blacker and blacker.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a silence, instant and deep, fell on the
gathering.  The Kaffir girl scuttled behind a shed with
noiseless celerity.  From the door of the farm issued
two people&mdash;Tante Wilma, the Englishman's Boer
wife, and striding beside her corpulent bulk, the slim,
energetic figure of Carol Mayne, the English mission
priest in charge of the station.  Tante Wilma wore her
most repulsive expression, her sandy eyebrows lowering
over her cunning little eyes.  Ten years ago she had
been a handsome woman, in a redundant style; but
six children and an invalid husband had reduced her
form to shapelessness and her temper to rags and
tatters.
</p>

<p>
She hated the English cleric, and could not bear
that he should come and see her husband.  The Boer
Predikant would have sat and sympathised with her
over his coffee for a couple of hours after his professional
visit to the sick man.  Carol Mayne never seemed to
have an adequate idea of the importance of this woman,
who owned half Slabbert's Poort, and had married her
English overseer, a widower with a little girl of his
own.
</p>

<p>
She was evidently accompanying the young man
from the house much against her will.  About half way
across the yard, becoming perhaps aware of the audience
at the gate, the clergyman halted, just out of earshot.
He seemed earnestly recommending some particular
course of conduct to Mrs. Lutwyche, who stood sullenly
before him, hostility in every line of her coarse face.
</p>

<p>
The group of men at the gate dropped away silently,
singly or in pairs, avoiding the parson; and Bert was
left alone, his sullen scowl fixed upon the house, as though
willing it to render up the face he had stood there for
hours longing to see.
</p>

<p>
After a while, Mr. Mayne, having finished his colloquy
with Tante Wilma, lifted his hat with that unconscious
English University manner which had piqued her in her
husband, but which now she hated as only the ignorant
can hate the thing that they can never understand.
The young Englishman's parting salutation, delivered
so entirely as a matter of course, belonged to an order
of things which, had she been able, Tante Wilma would
have destroyed, ravaged, trampled under her gross feet.
</p>

<p>
She stood glowering upon him as he made straight
for the gate by which Bert still lounged.  And she was
pleased to note that the young man made no effort to
open it for his passage.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mestaer!" said Mr. Mayne, as he
reached the gate.  "How's the world treating you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm &mdash;&mdash; if I care how it treats me," was the
engaging response.
</p>

<p>
The smile that passed over Mayne's face was
particularly humorous and winning.
</p>

<p>
"Don't care came to a bad end," he said, "and that's
what I particularly hope won't happen to you.  Are
you going my way?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I'm staying here, if you're so mighty curious to
know my plans," was the answer, given with a
discourtesy so studied that to notice it would be to allow
the speaker to fancy that he had "scored."
</p>

<p>
The rudeness must, of course, have been obvious to
the priest, but he disregarded it entirely.  A smile
again flickered over his face, as of one who holds
a trump card.  "Well, then, good-night!" he said
briskly, opening the gate at once, and passing through
it with an air of having no time to waste.
</p>

<p>
Bert cast another look at the silent house.  Nobody
was in sight but the big Boer woman slouching back to
the doorway.  He lowered the point of his rapier, so to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"Say&mdash;how's he goin' on?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mayne at once dropped his appearance of hurry,
and closed the gate slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "he's just lingering.  It may last
two or three weeks yet.  God help him!"
</p>

<p>
Bert beat his clenched fist softly on the top bar of
the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Look here!" he burst out, as if the words were
torn from him, "they let you go in and out&mdash;you can
tell&mdash;you oughter know.  Is she givin' that girl hell?"
</p>

<p>
"I think things are going on much as they have done
this last six months," said Mayne, speaking reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"But what'll it be when he's gone?  I ask you that?
What kind of a life's she goin' to lead then?"
</p>

<p>
Mayne hesitated.  "I don't know," he said at length,
with a touch of reserve.
</p>

<p>
"You know how the she-devil hates her," hissed Bert.
"She won't keep her, never fear.  She'll chuck her out
to any of these blanked scum around the town, and
then say the girl's disgraced her, and she'll have no
more to do with her!  I know Tante Wilma!"
</p>

<p>
Mayne looked keenly and kindly at the excited
speaker.  He was sorry for him, from the bottom of
his heart; but what to say he did not know, without
betraying confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I think you see things in too black a light," he said
at last.  "Mrs. Lutwyche is not without a sense of duty,
though we know she is not good-tempered.  And Millie
is not friendless, nor incapable of taking her own part."
</p>

<p>
Bert lifted his leonine head, and pointed with a
gesture of his hand towards the house.
</p>

<p>
"He told me, with his blanky British pride, that
he'd sooner see her in her coffin than married to a
man with an ounce of Boer blood in him&mdash;him that
let a Boer woman marry him," he growled.  "He
knows my mother was English; I told him.  I'd
take care of her."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mayne was able to follow the trend of the
jerky, disconnected sentences.
</p>

<p>
"Millie's young yet to think of marriage," he said.
</p>

<p>
"She'll have to think about something worse, before
he's cold in his grave, or I'm much mistaken," said Bert,
scowling.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman pondered.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to speak to her father for you?"
he presently asked, point-blank.
</p>

<p>
Bert hesitated; he grew red, then pale.
</p>

<p>
"Don't like to be beholden to me, do you?" said
Mayne cheerfully.  "Well, I sympathise with you.
But you and I are just walking round the question,
you know, Mestaer.  The whole point is, what does
Millie say?  Will she have you?"
</p>

<p>
The colour again rushed over the crestfallen face of
Bert.  "Gals like that don' know what they want," he
grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Then it would be very wrong to push her into a
life-long contract."
</p>

<p>
"She don' know what's good for her," repeated Bert.
"She'd oughter be arranged for; that's the way to do
it.  She'd not repent it if she married me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, look here; I'll make a bargain.  If Millie
comes to me and says she's willing to marry you, I'll
speak to Mr. Lutwyche; but you know quite as well
as I do, he would never hear of it against her will."
</p>

<p>
Hereupon Bert damned first British pride, then his
own Boer ancestry, then Tante Wilma, who had
caused her husband to contemn all Boers for her
sake.
</p>

<p>
"Swear-words won't help your cause, be sure of
that," observed Mayne drily.  "English girls aren't
going to be won that way."
</p>

<p>
"Think I'd say words like that to her?"
</p>

<p>
"More than probably.  Well, good-night!  I'm due
at the Mission; not coming, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," breathed Bert, and said no more; for his eyes
were fixed upon a little shadowy figure, moving under
the shadow of the stoep.
</p>

<p>
Mayne saw it too, and walked quietly away.

CHAPTER II

MILLIE

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The sun had dropped, as the red billiard ball slips into
the pocket, suddenly behind the heaving mass of veldt.
Darkness was advancing with tropical, seven-leagued
stride, and all things were grey.
</p>

<p>
The pale figure detached itself from the shadows, and
resolved itself into the advancing form of a frail,
undeveloped girl of fifteen or sixteen.  A strange eye
would have been lost in wonder, at the first glance, as
to what Bert Mestaer could see here, on which to fix
his turbulent affections.
</p>

<p>
His lady-love was skinny, hollow-chested, stooping
and round-backed; her arms were almost like sticks.
</p>

<p>
She wore a soiled calico gown, too long behind for its
length in front.  Her pale-coloured hair was drawn off
her white face, and plaited into an untidy pig tail which
hung down her back.  Certain small wisps of it escaped
in front, and made what looked in the dim light like the
rudiments of a nimbus about her head.  She was drawn
down on one side by the weight of the heavy, clanking,
copper bucket which she carried.
</p>

<p>
The well was right across the yard, quite near the
gate where Bert stood, and his large person was very
visible; but the girl came on with no sign that she saw
him; and, reaching the well, hooked her bucket on the
chain, and let it down, with a stony, expressionless
countenance.
</p>

<p>
Bert leaned over the gate; the expression of his face
had altered completely.
</p>

<p>
"Millie," he said, below his breath, "Millie!"
</p>

<p>
She gave him a listless glance, from weary,
heavy-lidded, dark-blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good evening!" she said curtly.
</p>

<p>
He unlatched the gate, came through, and took the
windlass out of her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Thought you promised not to come inside," she
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Only jest ter wind up this"&mdash;perhaps the thought
of Mayne and the swear-words flitted across his mind,
for he pulled up short, and merely finished lamely
with&mdash;"this 'ere bucket."
</p>

<p>
"What's an ear-bucket?" asked Miss Lutwyche, with
cold contempt.
</p>

<p>
He winced like a child from a cane, but made no
retort, merely setting all his finely developed muscles
a-play, as he raised the gleaming bucket from the depths.
When it was at the top, he paused.
</p>

<p>
"How's he to-night, Millie?"
</p>

<p>
"Mean my father?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Lutwyche."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, same's usual."
</p>

<p>
Bert's chest heaved with the burden of all he wished
to say, and dare not.  Some instinct, deep down in
him, warned him not to speak to the girl of her father's
fast-approaching end.  And yet&mdash;he thought of all that
Mayne had said!  Now was his chance, if ever, to
declare his passion.  He wondered whether Mayne, or
anybody else, knew how distant were the terms between
him and Millie, what an impregnable barrier she stood
behind, how far he was from being on such a footing as
might be supposed to immediately precede a proposal
of marriage.  His tongue clave to the roof of his mouth,
and he felt the sweat break out upon him.
</p>

<p>
The girl moved, leaned over to detach the bucket
from the hook.  He started, and reaching quickly
forward, brought it down upon the side of the well where
he stood.
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' to carry it indoors for you," he said
sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
She turned, without a word of thanks, and began to
walk back to the house.
</p>

<p>
He strode beside her, in the gathering gloom, his
whole being aching with the desire to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
"Millie," he said at last, "if&mdash;if she does anythin' to
yer&mdash;if she gets too bad, or lays hands upon yer, you
jest come to me, or send for me, won't yer?"
</p>

<p>
The girl let fall a laugh of such quiet scorn that he
felt openly sneered at.
</p>

<p>
"D'you think I'm afraid of her, then?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said warmly; "you've got the pluck of
the&mdash;" he checked and almost choked&mdash;"the pluck of a
dozen.  But she's stronger than you."
</p>

<p>
"Is she?" said Millie drily.
</p>

<p>
He pondered on that answer.
</p>

<p>
There spoke the careless insolence of the Briton.  He
admired it, while he writhed under it; but he
understood why it made Tante Wilma want to scratch her
eyes out.
</p>

<p>
They had reached the stoep.  Nobody was about.
He set down the bucket and faced her squarely.
</p>

<p>
"Millie," he almost gasped, "look here!  Give me a
word!  You know I'd&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke in.  "I got no time to talk.  I must take
this water inside.  Good-night!"
</p>

<p>
His choler rose.  "A chap may do what he will for
you, and you can't even throw him a word!"
</p>

<p>
Her languid expression changed; the dark blue eyes
flashed wide awake in the twilight.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't understand you wanted to be paid for
carrying the pail!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>damn</i> you!" cried Bert, hurt beyond endurance;
and he flung away in rage that was not far from tears.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that the moment he was gone, the girl
forgot him utterly.  She turned away and went inside
the <i>sitkamer</i> without a backward glance.
</p>

<p>
The <i>sitkamer</i> was full of her father's half-Boer
children: two great boys of eight and nine years old,
and three or four younger fry.  They were rolling about
on the floor, playing, fighting and cuffing.  Millie took
no more notice of them than if they had been mice or
black-beetles.  She filled the kettle from her pail, and
set it to boil, and then, going to a cupboard, got a fresh
egg, which she proceeded to whisk up in a tumbler, with
delicate care.
</p>

<p>
Tante Wilma rolled into the room, sat down by the
stove, took the coffee-pot off the rack, and poured herself
out a cupful, which she proceeded liberally to "lace"
with something stronger.  She sat sipping it, looking
furtively at her step-daughter as she moved, her small
face grimly set, noiselessly to and fro.  It is very rarely
indeed that a Boer woman takes to drink.  When she
does, she becomes a creature to be avoided.
</p>

<p>
When her arrangements were complete, Millie took
the tray and went out of the room, followed by
malevolent glances.
</p>

<p>
"White rat!" growled Xante Wilma, in the Taal.
</p>

<p>
The children started a kind of chorus:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "White rat!  White rat!<br>
  Ours is the corn that makes you fat!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Not much longer then," muttered the half-tipsy
Vrouw.  "Another week or two will see the end of it
now; and then&mdash;out she goes!  Aha!  She'll wish
before long that she had kept a civil tongue in her
head.  As sure as I'm a living woman, one thrashing
I'll give her before she goes!  Oh, there's a long account
I've got against her&mdash;it wants paying, that it does!
Much we've had to bear from him, but most from her
that encouraged him from a baby to defy me.  But I'll
take it out on her, once he's gone, the little insolent,
English devil!"

CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE RIVALS
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "But as if he loved you!  No, not he.<br>
  Nor anyone else in the world, 'tis plain;<br>
  Who ever heard that another, free<br>
  As I, young, prosperous, sound and sane,<br>
  Poured life out, proffered it&mdash;'Half a glance<br>
  Of those eyes of yours, and I drop the glass!'"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ROBERT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Bert Mestaer flung open the door of his farm kitchen,
and strode in.
</p>

<p>
All was clean and quiet.  His supper, covered up in
a saucepan, had been left on the stove.  Anna, his
Boer housekeeper, had long since retired to her heavy
slumbers.
</p>

<p>
The eye of the master roved round the kitchen that
night, like one who saw it for the first time.  He gazed
upon the ceiling, and noted that it needed fresh
lime-wash.  He contemplated the shining rows of plates on
the dresser, as though taking a new pride in his
possessions; and then, moving forward, he pushed open
a door at the opposite side of the room, and found
himself in darkness and coolness.  He struck a light, held
it to a candle on the table, and his critical glance
travelled round the parlour which had been his mother's
pride.
</p>

<p>
There was a piano; he had a dim memory of her
sitting there, playing to him, the hymns that had
charmed her own English childhood&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Once in Royal David's city&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the sound of the tune floated across the brain which for
so long had heard no such strains.  He saw himself, a
boy with yellow curls, in which she had delighted, lifting
his piercing childish treble at her bidding.  What would
she not have given for the English Mission which had
come to Slabbert's Poort since her death, and the
ministrations of Carol Mayne!  Bert had not entered
a church now, for years.  As he stood by her silent
piano, he was invaded by a vague feeling that he could
hardly expect a neglected God to take his part.
</p>

<p>
The room contained an old bureau and comfortable
chairs.  There were good engravings on the walls.
The carpet was still serviceable, and there were clean
curtains in the windows.  From the wall before him
smiled down his mother's frank, good-humoured face&mdash;the
face of Alice Brooke&mdash;a brave girl, who had earned
her living among strangers in a strange land, until the
rich Boer farmer had persuaded her to be his wife.
Beside her, the broad-bearded, benevolent face of her
devoted husband, a Boer of the best type.
</p>

<p>
Bert folded his arms, and gazed at them both, with a
heart full of curious longings, rebellions and regrets.
Mrs. Mestaer had died when he was eight years old.
Her death was the result of an accident&mdash;a runaway
horse had cut short the happy life on that out-of-the-way
farm; and people said that Mestaer had never rallied
from the shock.  He became an old man in a few short
months.  He turned a deaf ear to those who urged him
to take some expansive Boer lady to look after him and
his motherless boy, and he died of pneumonia when
Bert was seventeen, seeming only too glad of the
chance to be gone.
</p>

<p>
Bert did not remember feeling much grief when he
was told of his father's death.  He had been chiefly
conscious of the excitement of leaving school and
coming home to take possession of his property, and
ruffle it in the streets of Slabbert's Poort.
</p>

<p>
Just at that time had come the diamond-finding
craze, which changed the little rural hamlet into a
haunt of needy adventurers, gamblers and sharpers,
Slabbert's Poort was to be the new Kimberley.  The
usual influx of rabble followed; the usual mad period
of wild speculation.  To let off big portions of his land
to speculators had seemed to young Mestaer far more
"sporting" than to continue stolidly to farm the
precious acres.  He chummed in with the prospectors,
who were only too ready to flatter a young fellow with
money in his pockets.  The result was that his proper
business languished; and now it was universally allowed
that the diamond-bearing capacities of the locality had
been absurdly over estimated.
</p>

<p>
Bert had fallen into ways which would have wrung
his mother's heart, when, for good or ill, the white face
of Millie crossed his horizon, to remain as a fixed star
in his heavens.
</p>

<p>
To-night he was beginning to realise all that it might
have meant for him if his mother had lived.  She was
English; she would have understood and befriended
Millie; she would have told him the things that
English girls demand of their lovers, and have devised
ways in which the acquaintance might be encouraged.
</p>

<p>
There was not, as it happened, a solitary English-woman
in the place.  Mayne, at the Mission, was a
bachelor, so could not be used as a chaperon.  Millie
had never seen the interior of Bert's house in her life.
He felt sure that if she could see the rooms made
comfortable by his English mother, it must to her seem
preferable to her own miserable quarters.  She only
saw him slouching about the streets, in the unkempt
condition affected by his pals; she took him, he felt
sure, for other than he was, or than he felt himself
capable of becoming for her sake.
</p>

<p>
Remorsefully he remembered that Millie had seen
him drunk.  He had not cared at the time&mdash;the thing
was growing far too fashionable to be looked upon as a
disgrace in the little place which had been so pastoral&mdash;but
love was teaching him strange things, and now he
felt as though he were looking upon the sordid episode
of drunkenness through Millie's tired, contemptuous
eyes.
</p>

<p>
What would he not have given to be able to make
her understand that, if she would be kind to him, he
would be what she chose&mdash;to be able to show her the
clean, peaceful farm, known throughout the district as
High Farm, owing to its being the only house for miles
which was built English fashion on two floors&mdash;and tell
her that, if she would be mistress there, he would use all
his vast strength to work as never man worked before,
and keep her like a lady?
</p>

<p>
But how to get at her?  He felt that any written
expression of his desires would be ludicrously
inadequate.  At one time he thought of begging Mayne to
speak for him; but his pride jibbed too violently at the
notion of having to confess that he lacked courage to
speak.  His heart was heavy as lead.  Four times since
his last strikingly unsatisfactory interview he had hung
over the gate in vain.  Each evening it was Kattie the
Kaffir girl who had been sent to draw the water; and he
was too proud to send a message by her.
</p>

<p>
But on the fourth night he had yielded to unbearable
longing, and entrusted the grinning damsel with a note
for Millie&mdash;a folded scrap of paper, on which he had
written:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do let me have a word.  I'm so blamed sorry I
said that to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"BERT."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He had some self-questionings as to whether
"blamed" might be looked upon as a swear-word;
but he decided that it must be harmless.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't say that, dashed if I know what you
could say," he reflected irritably.
</p>

<p>
His heart beat insufferably as he watched the girl
stagger across the yard, the pail in one hand, the little
note in the other.
</p>

<p>
Strange thrills crept through his nerves, his breath
seemed to trouble him as he drew it If Millie
herself should come in answer, what should he say
to her?  He was all unprepared.
</p>

<p>
A shadowy figure was stealing towards him stealthily
in the gathering gloom.  It was slim&mdash;it moved quietly.
He grew crimson in the dark.  An unmistakable
Kaffir chuckle broke on his ear: it was only Kattie
back again.  She handed him a piece of paper and
ran away in an instant He struck a match and
looked eagerly at what he held: it was just his own
message, crumpled up and returned without comment.
</p>

<p>
He had been enraged, but not daunted for long.  It
was highly possible that Tante Wilma had got hold of
the message, and that Millie had never seen it.  The
thing now was to invent some new plan of campaign&mdash;some
scheme by which the plenty and good plenishing
of his home might burst upon the vision of the girl.
</p>

<p>
To-night he set down the kerosene lamp upon the
table, which had a serge cover of a good shade of
blue.  He surveyed the well-upholstered sofa, with
silk cushions of the same blue.  He tried, with
doubled fist, the springs of the deep easy-chair.  He
stared at the tall glass vases and glazed pots, and
dimly recalled the fact that in his mother's lifetime
these had been wont to hold flowers.  A girl would
like, perhaps, to see flowers in a room.  He believed
there were some in the yard; but he paid no attention
to them, and never gathered any.  A deep sigh escaped
him at the thought of his inability to cope with the
situation in general.
</p>

<p>
He strolled back with his lamp into the tiled kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Should he consult Amurrica?  The Yankee was the
only one of all the set for whom he entertained anything
but a profound and steady contempt.  And Amurrica
was, he knew, untrustworthy.  He had a secret
fear&mdash;which brought the blood to his head when he
considered it&mdash;that Amurrica himself was "on to Millie."  It
was possible that the Lutwyches might consider
an American more akin to themselves than the son
of a Boer.  Even as he turned the delicate subject
over and over in his thoughts, there came a tap at
his door, and a long whistle, which told him that
the man who occupied his thoughts stood upon his
threshold.
</p>

<p>
He went and opened, standing aside as the visitor
sauntered in, and manifesting no curiosity as to the
reason of so late a call.  Amurrica shut the door
carefully behind him, and walked to the clean hearth.
His face was of the hatchet variety, not handsome, but
keen, with that eagle keenness which is the hall-mark
of a certain type of American.  The humour in his
half-closed hazel eyes atoned for their lack of size;
the composure of his manner hid his real thoughts
from sight.  Bert had never before considered him
formidable, but to-night he was conscious of a
foreboding as he mechanically produced the whisky-jar
from a corner cupboard, and pushed it across the
table.  Amurrica sat down.
</p>

<p>
His eye roved around restless until it lighted upon
the spittoon in the corner by the hearth.  He made his
shot with precision, and then, laying his pipe on the
table, began to pour whisky into a tumbler.
</p>

<p>
"'S come at last," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked Bert, slouching in his chair, his
listless eyes on the fading red glimmer between the bars
of the stove.
</p>

<p>
Amurrica shifted slightly in his seat, so as to face his
host squarely.  He took a pull at his whisky before
replying casually:
</p>

<p>
"Lutwyche is cuttin' the stick."
</p>

<p>
There was silence.  Bert knew he was being watched;
felt instinctively that the time had come.  With no
other word spoken, he knew that they were rivals; that
it would be perhaps a question of which man was
prepared to give most to the Boer step-mother for the
attainment of what he desired.  He must feign
indifference; for aught he knew, Amurrica might have
his shooting-iron in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
He had no personal fear of him; his fears were all
for Millie.  His love was teaching him stratagem.
</p>

<p>
His eyelids did not flicker, he did not even remove
his pipe from his mouth.  Amurrica's eyes were boring
him like gimlets, but he puffed calmly on, his thoughts
racing each other over the well-known ground.  What
was he to do?
</p>

<p>
"Who told you?" he presently vouchsafed.
</p>

<p>
"Met Boka, galloping for the doctor like the very
devil."
</p>

<p>
Boka was one of Lutwyche's Kaffirs.
</p>

<p>
Bert asked no question, manifested no curiosity; but
the other was full of news, and intent upon imparting it.
</p>

<p>
"Said the gal had made him sleep in the kitchen
nights, for a week past, 'n case she needed to call him
up.  To-night, down she come with a face like chalk,
and told him to ride like hell: said he judged by the
looks of her the ole man was gone already."
</p>

<p>
Again there was a silence, while both smoked.  Bert
presently spoke&mdash;two words:
</p>

<p>
"Mayne there?"
</p>

<p>
"Mayne?  Not that I know of."  A surprised inflection
in the voice.
</p>

<p>
"Then I think," said Mestaer, slowly rising to his full
height, and knocking his pipe against the chimney,
to dislodge the dottle&mdash;"I think I'd better go an'
send him."
</p>

<p>
"What's the blank good of that?" cried Amurrica, in
a choice outburst of astonished profanity.
</p>

<p>
"Parson's the right man when it comes to dyin', ain't
he?" said Bert tranquilly.  "An' you done right to
come an' tell me, Amurrica, for I'm the man who's
concerned in this.  I thank you.  Put yourself outside
o' that whisky, an' I'll make so free as to turn you out."
</p>

<p>
He was moving quietly about the room as he spoke,
opening drawers, and Amurrica saw him slip a revolver
into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
The Yankee sat for a minute with a frozen face,
digesting his plans.  Then he stood up, and his features
relaxed towards a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Well, here's luck!" he said, draining his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!" said Bert
</p>

<p>
He approached the table, and took the empty glass,
as though to carry it away; but as he moved, it slipped
through his fingers, and fell in shivers upon the floor.
Amurrica's nostrils twitched: was it an accident?  Bert
said "Damn!" quite naturally, and kicked the fragments
with his foot.  A second time his visitor decided,
upon reflection, not to quarrel; and they left the house
together.

CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE GUARDIANSHIP OF CAROL MAYNE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "These mothers are too dreadful!"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Millie sat before the cold hearth in the stale, stuffy
<i>sitkamer</i>, which always smelt of dirty dish-cloths and
unwashed humanity.  Her lips were pressed tightly
together, her face was white as wax.  In its repose, one
could see signs of the inner strength, the unnameable
charm which had captivated Bert and Amurrica, beyond
question the two cleverest men of the place.  No young
Boer would have looked twice at her.
</p>

<p>
Her father was dead.  The doctor had come and gone,
and told the orphan what she knew before.  The death
had been quiet and painless, only Millie there.  But
now, the Boer widow was beside the corpse, noisily
weeping and wailing, and the girl was shut out.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps a fortunate thing for Arnold Lutwyche
that his inherent vacillation of character had been joined
to a feebleness of constitution which released him, at
the age of forty-two, from the burden of the flesh.  He
had passed beyond reach of the Boer woman's tongue,
and of the complications presented by those lumpish
Boer children who bore his name.  His difficulties were
over; but what of his child?
</p>

<p>
His first wife&mdash;his own love, and Millie's mother&mdash;had
been the earthly stay of the weak soul.  Everyone
had always called him weak; but he had had the wisdom
to love the strong, the fortune to be loved by her again.
While she lived, his own lack of stamina had hardly been
apparent to him.  He had never quite lost his sense of
having a grudge against God since her death.
</p>

<p>
What he had been through since!  From the moment
when the handsome, courteous Englishman, with the
dark-blue eyes, presented himself in answer to an
advertisement from the buxom Boer heiress for a
competent man to manage her farm, his misery had
increased, his bonds had tightened.  But it was over at
last.  He had slipped through Tante Wilma's coarse
fingers, and gone flying home to her, his love, his
stronghold.
</p>

<p>
Their child was left behind.
</p>

<p>
She had apparently no tears for him.  The look on
her tense features was more triumphant than grieving.
</p>

<p>
A smart tap on the door aroused her.  She looked up
in languid surprise.  The old Dutch clock pointed to
three o'clock in the morning.  With a resigned shrug,
she lifted her aching limbs, dragged herself to the door,
and opened it.  Mr. Mayne stood outside, and stepped
in without speaking, closely followed by Bert Mestaer.
Millie drew back, a look of anything but welcome on
her expressive face.
</p>

<p>
"Go back!" said she to the young farmer.  "I don't
want you round here, nor any of your lot."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I came to see if I couldn't help, Millie."
stammered he humbly.
</p>

<p>
In dialogue with the girl he seemed always to become
a different creature.  To-night there was some apparent
difficulty in articulating, as his eyes rested on the
untamed fire of the glance, and the droop of the small,
exhausted frame.
</p>

<p>
"Let him come in and rest a minute, Miss Lutwyche,"
said Mr. Mayne gently.  "He came all the way to the
Mission to let me know."
</p>

<p>
"How'd he hear, I should like to know?" she
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Amurrica told me," stammered Bert, staring at the
ground.
</p>

<p>
She gave a short laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Trust him to know other folks' business," she
sneered.  "He's the old woman's candidate, he is."
</p>

<p>
"Candidate?  What for, Millie?" asked Mayne
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
She had turned away, and Bert had fastened the
door.  She sank on a chair, leaning an arm on the
table, the slenderness of her wrist, as it lay there, making
a dumb appeal to all the manliness in Bert.
</p>

<p>
"For taking me off her hands," she said, with perfect
calmness.  "I'm on offer, didn't you know?  Either o'
you two in the running?  Amurrica's given her ten
quid on account; you'd better bet on his chances, unless
you can go higher."
</p>

<p>
"That's not the way to talk," said Mayne sternly.
"What do you mean by it?  You are far too young to
think of marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Who said I was thinkin' about marriage?" she
flashed back.  "Am I the old woman?  Am I to
answer for her dirty bargains?"
</p>

<p>
"Then tell us what you mean," said Mayne.  "Is it
true that Otis wants to marry you?"
</p>

<p>
Otis was Amurrica's patronymic.
</p>

<p>
"I don' know," said Millie casually.  "I only know
he's pretty thick with the old woman; an' she doesn't
mean to let me go for nothing; all of you can bet
on that."
</p>

<p>
"But why talk this nonsense?" urged Mayne
reprovingly.  "Mrs. Lutwyche couldn't dispose of you
against your will, even if you were a Kaffir."
</p>

<p>
Milly laughed&mdash;one clear, liquid note.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course she can't," said she.  "That's where
the joke comes in.  Think I'd go along o' that sort
o' scum?"
</p>

<p>
She indicated poor Bert with a slight wave of that
fragile wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Then what are you goin' to do, Millie?" burst out
the young man in anguish.  "If she turns you out,
where're you goin'&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"What's it matter to you?" asked Millie sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"'S the only thing that does matter to me!" cried
Bert desperately.  "Look here!"  He flung his hat on
the table, and stepped in front of her with a sudden
manliness which filled Mayne with admiration.  "You
don' know the sort of home I've got to offer you,
Millie.  I'm a rich man, as things go round here.  I'd
give yer pretty well anything you set your heart on.
I'd take care of yer&mdash;yer shouldn't set them bits of
hands to no rough work.  I love you, Millie, and well
you know it.  Let the parson here marry us, an
I'll&mdash;I'll do anything you want!"
</p>

<p>
He knelt down by the table as he concluded his
appeal, and made a snatch for her hand; but it was
sharply withdrawn.  He laid his arms down on the
rough wood, and hid his face in them, shaken through
and through by the intensity of his feelings.  Mayne
turned away, and walked to the far end of the kitchen.
But he heard the girl's short laugh of scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Tastes differ," she said icily.  "I'm an English girl,
and if the worst comes to the worst, there's the well in
the courtyard.  That's better than a drinkin' Boer."
</p>

<p>
"Millie," said Mayne, in wrath, "I am ashamed of
you!  Is that the way to answer an honest man, who
offers you all he has to give?  I am as English as you
are, and I beg to say no Englishwoman I ever knew
offered insult as a return for honour done her.  If you
can't feel affection for Bert, surely you could tell him so
civilly."
</p>

<p>
The girl's fragile form quivered with dry sobs; she
sprang to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mestaer, I can't and don't return your affection,"
she gasped.  "I'm brought pretty low, but I've got my
pride!  I'm thinkin' just now more about funerals than
about weddin's, though a black frock for me'll be as
hard to fi-f-find as a white one would, I'm thinkin'!"
</p>

<p>
"There!" cried Bert to Mayne, in hot indignation.
"You made her cry now.  Millie, my dear, now don't
you give it a thought.  I didn't know it 'ud vex
you! ... Millie!"
</p>

<p>
But she had staggered blindly down the room, not
seeing her way for the streaming tears so long so
unnaturally restrained; and as Bert stood hesitating,
torn between his pity, his anger, his passion&mdash;the door
of the kitchen opened slowly, and the new-made widow
appeared on the threshold, truly awful in her <i>déshabille</i>.
</p>

<p>
"A clever girl, I'll warrant!" she cried, in high glee.
"Her father not cold yet, and two young men in the
kitchen at four o'clock in the morning!  Well, what
offers, gentlemen?  Either of you ready to take her off
my hands?"
</p>

<p>
"I am," burst in Bert at once, before Mayne could
speak.  "Fifty pounds down and a demi-john of the
best whisky in Slabbert's Poort, and I'll make her my
wife to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Millie!" screamed the virago to the girl, who had
reached the ladder leading to her little room above.
"Here's a husband for you, my girl!  Get your bundle
and pack!  Off with you!  Out of my house!  We're
all respectable here!  Take your English lady-wife,
Mr. Bert Mestaer."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mayne stepped forwards.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would be so kind as to listen to me for
a moment, Mrs. Lutwyche," he said distinctly.  "Your
late husband made a will, and left it in my hands.  In
it I am appointed his daughter's sole guardian, until she
reaches the age of twenty-one.  The arrangements for
her future rest with me, and have nothing whatever to
do with you.  If she remains with you for a week or
two, until her affairs are settled, you will be paid a
fixed sum daily, out of Mr. Lutwyche's small estate,
as long as you keep her.  But you have absolutely no
control whatever over her marriage."
</p>

<p>
Vrouw Lutwyche gave a positive howl of fury.  Her
face grew purple&mdash;almost black; her eyes protruded,
her rage was hideous and ungovernable.  For so long
had she waited for this moment&mdash;this coming time
when she should have Millie helpless at her mercy&mdash;she
simply could not realise that all was taken out of
her hands.
</p>

<p>
Millie's tears had ceased.  In surprise at what
Mr. Mayne was saying, she had halted on her way up the
ladder, the drops wet on her cheeks.  Now she slowly
came back to the ground, and stood with a set smile,
showing her row of short, pearl-white teeth, as she
gloated over the spectacle of the Boer woman's
degradation.  He had been weak, that father who had
left her; he had disappointed her over and over again;
but after all, there had been something in him which
Vrouw Lutwyche could not reach.  In death he had
outwitted her.
</p>

<p>
Mayne's very soul sickened.  He had seen much
that revolted him in this wild land of beginnings&mdash;of
that measure of civilisation which sometimes seems so
strongly to plead the fact that utter savagery would be
better.  But he thought he had never seen anything
more awful than the enmity of this girl's face&mdash;the
hatred, the callous contempt, which showed how often
the young eyes had looked upon like scenes.
</p>

<p>
"If she is left here, she will go mad," he thought;
and again he earnestly wished that poor Lutwyche
could have held on just another fortnight, until the
arrival of certain letters from England.  He was at his
wits' end.  There was not a house anywhere near to
which he dare take Millie.  He was in sole charge of
the Mission, and in that evil place, to take her there,
would be to blast her character.  He thought of a
good-natured old Boer widow woman who lived about
a mile away, and stepping up to Millie, he suggested
in an undertone, that she should go there.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot remain here," he urged.
</p>

<p>
Her refusal was prompt and resolute.
</p>

<p>
"Leave him alone in the house with her?  Never!"
she said doggedly.  "You don't know what she might
do.  I'm not afraid of her.  She daren't touch me, and
she can't go up my ladder.  She's roaring drunk now,
but she'll be dead drunk presently, and then she's
harmless.  If you come round in the morning, I shall
be able to talk to you; she'll take hours to sleep this
off.  I wish you'd go now, and take away that Bert.
I've got no use for him."

CHAPTER V
<br><br>
A BOER BURYING
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "&mdash;Within some glass, dimmed by our breath,<br>
  Our hearts discern wild images of Death,<br>
  Shadows and shoals that edge Eternity."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The sunrise flashed into their eyes, as the farm-house
door closed upon the two men.  They went together
through the yard, and out at the gate where Bert had
so often watched in vain for Millie.  Their steps echoed
with an unfamiliar ring upon the hard, caked earth at
this unwonted hour of stark, raw dawn.  The sight of
the well gave Bert a twinge as he passed it.
</p>

<p>
"Even that 'ud be better than a drinkin' Boer," he
muttered, under his breath.
</p>

<p>
Before they had gone much farther, he grappled
with the new fear that was clutching at his heart.
</p>

<p>
"I say," he growled, stopping and planting himself
before Mr. Mayne, who of necessity stopped also;
"what did you mean by what you said up there about
letters from England?  She&mdash;she hasn't got friends in
England, has she?"
</p>

<p>
"It is very doubtful," said Mayne hesitatingly.
"Look here, Mestaer!" he added abruptly.  "My hand
was forced just now.  You were not supposed to hear
what I said.  Can I trust you not to repeat it?"
</p>

<p>
"Repeat it!  Who'd I repeat it to?"
</p>

<p>
"Otis; or any of your lot."
</p>

<p>
"My lot!  That's her cry too.  Has she learnt it from
you?  Do you lump me in with Amurrica's crew of
thievin' idlers?  &mdash;&mdash; them all for a set of &mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mayne's hand went up with the slight gesture which
always stopped Bert's swearing.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer," he said, "after what we have just seen,
you will drop your fancy for Millie, won't you?  There
are girls who will play with a man's love to the very
brink of the end; but if a girl has any sort of feeling
for a man, she will turn to him in her trouble.  Millie
doesn't care for you&mdash;you must see that, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
Bert looked as though he had been suddenly turned
into a graven image.  Meeting the squareness of his
jaw, the metallic glint of his hard grey eye, Mayne
was conscious anew of the dreadful strength of
undisciplined human nature, and the imperious quality of
its desires.  One is sometimes apt to wonder what
twenty centuries of Christianity have done for Europe.
The answer to the question stares you in the face the
moment you step outside the circle in which Christianity
has insensibly moulded public opinion.
</p>

<p>
"If she don't want me, she don't want no other
man," said the giant doggedly; "and look how young
she is.  I've got patience; I can wait.  But if she's
going to be taken off to England&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, and began to walk on.
</p>

<p>
"If she is going away to England?" repeated Mayne,
trudging beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, then, I don't know as how I can."
</p>

<p>
Mayne thought rapidly for a minute.
</p>

<p>
"You're not reasonable," he said.  "You own that
Millie's too young to be married; but you wouldn't have
her stay in Vrouw Lutwyche's clutches, would you?"
</p>

<p>
"The worse they treat her, the more likely she is
to come to me," said Bert calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Or to Otis."
</p>

<p>
"Chuck it!" burst out Bert hoarsely.  "Chuck it,
I tell you."  He shook with all the inward feelings
which he could not explain.  How could he say that
it scorched him with sheer physical heat and shame,
to hear Amurrica even suggested as a mate for Millie?
"He'd poison her soul," he groaned; and Mayne
felt an acute inward sympathy with him.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer," he said kindly.  "It seems very doubtful
whether any of the English relations of Millie's mother
will be willing&mdash;or if willing, able to receive her.  Her
father has left in my hands a little sum of money&mdash;very
small, but enough to pay her passage home.  It appears
that the family of the first Mrs. Lutwyche all disapproved
of her marriage.  They are poor proud people, and as he
has had no communication with them since her death, I
do not even know whether his letter will reach them.
If however they do write, and if they offer to have the
girl home, on any terms, you have the sense to see that
she most certainly ought to go."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she won't go.  Who's goin' to make her?"
</p>

<p>
"I am her guardian," said Mayne, very quietly.
</p>

<p>
"If you try an' make her do anything she don't wanter,
I'll choke you with my own hands," said Bert earnestly.
</p>

<p>
The priest was unable to help smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer, if you had lived in other days, you would
have been a devout lover," he said.  "As it is, you are
a bit of a barbarian, are you not?"
</p>

<p>
"A drinkin' Boer; that's it, if you want to do any
classifying," retorted the young man, with exceeding
bitterness; and with no parting salutation, he flung
off, turned the corner leading to the High Farm, and
marched away, leaving Mayne to pursue the road to
the Mission alone.
</p>

<p>
The news he had heard was working like some
stimulating drug in the young farmer's brain.  The
fatal word "England" lit up the future in one long,
awful glare, as of an endless avenue along which
he seemed to see himself moving&mdash;alone.  Surely
there was something that a strong man could do
to chain a girl's affections!  What charm can lead a
spirit captive?  Bert knew well enough, though he
never said so to himself in set terms, not being by
way of analysing his emotions&mdash;he knew that it was
Millie's self, her love, her soul, her inmost being,
that he longed for.  If he could make her long for
him as he longed for her!  He thought of the cold,
white face and little delicate, sneering mouth till he
was half mad.
</p>

<p>
The only plan of campaign which suggested itself
was the simple one of being always on hand.  He
felt pretty sure, in his own mind, that the girl's
stepmother would try to get even with her somehow.  Her
prey was to be snatched out of her hands; it would be
odd if she made no attempt to revenge herself.  The
girl knew no fear; she had successfully cowed and
defied the bullying woman for years.  But Bert, with
Boer intuitions in his blood, felt that she was less
secure than she thought herself.  It was truly British
to despise an adversary; but it was a British mistake,
sometimes.  The kind of hate that Tante Wilma felt
was hate that would improve with keeping.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, Bert passed the next day or two in
mounting guard in the immediate neighbourhood.
There were various outbuildings which made it easy
to hang about unseen, and he went to his post before
Otis and the others were about.
</p>

<p>
On the first day, life at the farm went on much
as usual.  As Millie had foreseen, Tante Wilma was
not visible.  Various Boer ladies of her acquaintance
came to condole, and discuss the purchase of widow's
mourning.  Mayne came and saw Millie, and gave
her the money to supply her own black dress, which
she sat up all night to make.  There was no need
for Bert to wait about when once he had seen the
light of the candle in the little square patch of glass
in the corrugated iron roof that lighted Millie's garret.
In that fastness she was safe&mdash;safe among the coffins.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] In remote Boer districts, a coffin or two is frequently kept in
the loft, ready for emergencies.  Apples and fruit for winter use
are sometimes stored in these weird receptacles.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Amurrica came not near the farm all that day.
Perhaps it had leaked out that the Vrouw was not
in a fit state for the conduct of negotiations.
</p>

<p>
The next day the vigilant lover patiently returned to
his post, and waited until dark.  Millie was all right, so
far, for a Boer woman had been all day long plying her
needle at the farm, and the pallid, unwholesome little
man who fulfilled the profitable duties of undertaker to
the community had been shuffling in and out all day.
Moreover, the girl herself had appeared in the yard, and
been occupied there for more than an hour in hanging
out wet linen, unconscious that she was watched from
behind the thick hedge of prickly pear which enclosed
the orchard, with its haze of peach blossom.  Bert made
no sign of his presence.  He had determined now upon
his role, and adhered to it with characteristic persistency.
His plan was to bide his time, and come on the scene
when Millie needed a champion.  Her extremity was to
be his opportunity.
</p>

<p>
About nine o'clock, Amurrica stepped briskly up to
the stoep, and was admitted by Millie herself.  The
sentinel, much excited, stood by, every muscle tense,
in view of emergencies.  At the end of about three
minutes, the square of candle-light appeared in the
roof, gladdening the lover's heart.  Millie had retired
to her stronghold, out of reach of importunity.  He
determined to stand his ground, however, until the
departure of Otis.  The sound of raised voices was
soon heard.  No doubt Amurrica was demanding the
return of his "ten quid," and demanding it of course
in vain.  It must have come in very handy for the
purchase of the funeral garb and bake-meats.  He did
not stay very long.  The invisible Bert studied his
countenance as he emerged, but as was usual with
him, there was not much to be learnt from it.  It
was non-committal.  Bert, as he strolled home, fell to
imagining what his next move was likely to be.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of the third day, four women were
ceaselessly at work upon the solid feast which was
to conclude the obsequies of Arnold Lutwyche, in a
manner befitting the importance and position of his
widow.  The kitchen was a scene of bustle, excitement,
constant coming and going.  Bert wondered how Millie
stood it.  Tante Wilma, the centre of attraction, kept
meritoriously sober during all this exciting period, and
Bert knew that the girl was safe, at least from physical
violence, while all these people were about.
</p>

<p>
Next day, the funeral took place.  It happened to be
the first Boer funeral that Carol Mayne had ever seen;
and he found himself unprepared for it.  From early
dawn the cape carts and slow waggons kept coming in
from all the country-side.  He did not at first divine
that all these people were come solely to attend the
funeral.  The Pieters family, to which Tante Wilma
belonged, was the leading clan of the district; and
before noon at least two hundred were assembled, some
of them having come distances of thirty or forty miles
for the sake of being present.
</p>

<p>
When he arrived at Lutwyche's, the ceremony of
viewing the corpse was in active process.  Just to the
left of the stoep, before you entered the <i>sitkamer</i>, was
a small room, the function of which seemed indeterminate.
Here, in one of the coffins which had for so
long borne Millie company in her loft, lay the dead
Englishman, his face still uncovered.  By his side, as
master of the ceremonies, stood the widow's senior
male cousin, Cornells Pieters, a typical Boer, with a
reputation for beating his wife.  His fluent Taal was
not very comprehensible to Mayne; but a sick disgust
came over him at the way in which he was, as it were,
acting showman&mdash;stroking back the dead man's hair,
pushing or poking his hands or cheeks with great
stumpy fingers, and encouraging the never-ending
stream of gazers to handle the corpse and finger the
linen.  A great laugh would go up if some young
woman or child made outcry at the unexpected coldness
of contact.  Mayne's thoughts flew to Millie, and he
wondered how she would bear this.  But he could
not see her anywhere.  The widow, surrounded by
her children, and evidently deriving moral support
from a black-bordered pocket-handkerchief, sat in
the <i>sitkamer</i> receiving condolences.  But Millie was
invisible.
</p>

<p>
Mayne was on delicate ground here.  The dead man
had expressly stipulated that he should be laid to rest
with the words of his own liturgy, and the services of
the English priest; but the Boer Predikant was in
evidence, and Carol, who was quick to learn, and was
beginning to understand local etiquette, stepped up to
him, and asked him to say a prayer, when&mdash;the ghoulish
corpse-inspection over at last&mdash;the coffin was screwed
down, borne in, and triumphantly placed upon the family
dining-table.
</p>

<p>
The Predikant, gratified, though hardly placated, took
full advantage of his opportunities.  He talked to the
Almighty about himself, the Pieters family and the
Boer nation, for three quarters of an hour; while Tante
Wilma's noisy, snuffling sobs filled the place.
</p>

<p>
After this Mayne stepped forward, and read the first
part of the burial service.  Then the coffin was raised
and borne solemnly out, and down the fields beyond
the Kaffir huts, to where a stone wall enclosed the little
family burying-ground.
</p>

<p>
Melicent Lutwyche, standing by the open grave, saw
the procession coming, and the sight of Mayne's figure,
bareheaded and white-robed, shook her fortitude for the
first time.  Her eyes began to burn with unshed tears.
All these days, all these sleepless nights, her heart had
never ceased to repeat: "I am glad!  I am glad!  He
is safe now&mdash;free!  Out of her clutches for ever!"  But
now a new and desolating thought supervened&mdash;suggested
somehow by the liturgy's majestic words&mdash;the
thought of his immense distance from herself.  Heaven
had formed no part of her conception of his release from
captivity; now the anthem of Resurrection smote her
with inarticulate pain.  What had she, with a heart
full of black hatred, to do with Resurrection?  The white
flowers in her hands shook; she was shivering from head
to foot on the verge of a breakdown.
</p>

<p>
Then, foremost among the great throng of following
people, she saw Amurrica's hatchet profile, and her
thoughts, just painfully striving to take wing, sank back
to the black, bad earth she knew.  Warfare was still her
portion.  Amurrica and Bert Mestaer should never see
her weep.  She turned, moved a little, and stood exactly
at the grave's head.  The light was behind her, and to
Bert she seemed like an austere angel, waiting to bestow
the dead in some still sanctuary, where vulgar hands and
tongues could reach him no longer.  As the earth and
stones fell pattering on the coffin, her white blooms
fluttered down with them.  The set intensity of her
small white face fairly terrified her new guardian.
</p>

<p>
The service over, people cheered up, and hurried back
to the farm to eat and drink before setting out upon
their long return journeys.  Mayne made Bert a signal
to wait behind.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer," he said, "I have to ride to Leitersdorp
and get this will proved.  I can't get back inside three
days.  I am setting off at once, and I expect to find a
letter from England waiting for me at Mr. Crick's office,
so that, when I come back, I shall know better what to
do with Millie.  Can I trust you while I am gone?"
</p>

<p>
He looked searchingly at the young man's face.
</p>

<p>
Bert grinned.  "To punch Amurrica's head?  Oh, yes!"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly!  Or your own, if you should feel that you
deserve it."
</p>

<p>
Bert shrugged.  He was in a hurry.  He hardly
paused to realise what the three days' absence of the
guardian might mean.  His memory was centred upon
the strained expression of Millie's little face, and he
knew, by the faculty of divination which possessed him
where she was concerned, that she was near the end of
her powers of endurance.  He had premonition that
before long she must collapse.  It seemed like a duel
between him and her.  When she gave in he would be
glad, but he must be there.  This was just now all that
mattered&mdash;that he should be near her when the steel
springs of her will relaxed.
</p>

<p>
He hurried away with an abstracted air the moment
Mayne had finished speaking; and Mayne, with a sigh,
wondered whether he had done right to tell him of his
departure&mdash;whether he did right to go.  Until the will
was proved, he felt uncertain of being able to maintain
his authority against Vrouw Lutwyche and her ignorant
kinsfolk; he felt that a weight would be off his mind
when he was safely back again.  There was an Anglican
sisterhood at Leitersdorp, and he wished to inquire
whether the girl might be placed there for a time
should circumstances render it necessary.  But his
guardianship was a real puzzle, and it was seriously
complicated by the passion of Bert Mestaer.

CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE FLINGING OF THE GAGE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "What god, then, bade those two stand forth and strive?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;C. S. CALVERLEY.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All the world of Slabbert's Poort was enclosed
within the walls of "Lutwyche's."  The funeral feast
waxed noisier and noisier; there were the elements
of discord trembling in the cup.  Boer <i>v.</i> Briton was
soon to be the order of the day, and the present
company was largely composed of disappointed
men&mdash;those who had come to clutch diamonds, and had
found none.  Their sense that the times were out of
joint had been growing by degrees, in proportion as
their prospects waned; and the war rumours were fanning
it into flame.  Visions of plunder danced before their
eyes.  They would have torn treasure from the bowels
of the earth; if this was denied them, there was many
a rich homestead for the sacking, much plunder scattered
here and there over the wide land.  This was what war
meant to most of them.  A few were English, but the
great majority were Africanders.  Amurrica was the
only man of ability among them.  He meant to throw
in his lot with the winning side, "anyway"; but he
had for days past been making highly inflammatory
speeches, from the Boer point of view, in the saloon of
the Vierkleur.
</p>

<p>
The festivities were well begun when Bert Mestaer
walked in.  He was not popular now.  Most of those
present were jealous of his possessions, and of his great
physical strength.  They thought him reserved, and
nobody ever forgot that his mother was English.  It
was not considered certain which side he would take in
the forthcoming struggle.
</p>

<p>
He was greeted with a clamour of welcome which
held an underlying sneer.  He took no notice; he was
not quarrelling to-day.  His courage and strength were
facts too universally accepted for him to care to prove
them.  His grey eyes went like lightning about the
room, till he discerned Millie, a large apron pinned
over her black dress, staggering under the pile of
plates which she was carrying to the wash-house.  He
pressed forward at once, as if nobody else had been
present, took the girl's burden from her; and they went
out of the room together, followed by laughter and jeers.
</p>

<p>
They reached the sink, already piled with unwashed
dishes.  Bert deposited those which he carried, looked
around, spied a broken-backed chair, and brought it to
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Millie began to roll up her sleeves.  "I got to wash
these," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, I tell you," said Bert, in a low voice.  He
stood between her and her work.  "Can't I see that
you're just fit to drop in your tracks?  Sit down!  If
there's washing-up to be done, where's the nigger girl?"
</p>

<p>
Millie did not sit down.  She stood her ground: but
she did a thing she had never done before&mdash;lifted her
heavy lids, and looked up right into her lover's eyes.  A
wash of delicate carmine dyed her thin cheek-bones.
"It keeps me out of the room&mdash;away from those
swine," she said, with a note almost of appeal in her
voice.
</p>

<p>
Bert felt his inmost being surge up wildly, as his
whole heart went forth to her, in answer to her first
confidence: the only word she had ever spoken which
seemed to distinguish between him and "those swine."  All
that was best in him arose, and strove to meet and
honour the favour she had shown.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," he said, in tones of easy friendship.
"You sit down an' tell me what to do.  I'm on to this
job."
</p>

<p>
In a second his coat was off and his sleeves rolled up.
He had flashed a look round, spied a boiling kettle on a
vilely-smelling paraffin stove, and filled the greasy
washbowl.  Millie subsided upon the chair with a resignation
which, had he known her better, would have alarmed
him.  As things were, it filled him with a wild enthusiasm.
But he determined to walk warily.  His face glowed
with enjoyment as he proceeded with his menial task.
He buckled down to work in good earnest, methodically
scraping the broken food off the dishes into the
dog-trough set by for the purpose, and handling the crockery
with skill which surprised the girl, who, sunk back in the
chair, watched him without a word.
</p>

<p>
But he was human.  After a while, it seemed to him
that his strenuous efforts merited encouragement.  He
ventured greatly.
</p>

<p>
"Millie, if these Britishers write and ask you to come
to them, shall you go?"
</p>

<p>
The girl started, as if his voice had roused her from
stupor.
</p>

<p>
"What business is it o' yours?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I told you that the night your father died," said
Bert, quite simply.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you want to know, I shall go, whether they
want me or whether they don't, so it won't make any
difference to you," she replied coldly.
</p>

<p>
He bit back the oath that leapt to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"You've made up your mind to that?" he said; his
voice was audibly unsteady.
</p>

<p>
"Think I'd stay here, with all the world to choose
from?" said she scornfully.  "Not if Slabbert's Poort
was paved with diamonds!  No, indeed; I do know
enough to know that all the world's not like this.  I'm
going to see what it is like."
</p>

<p>
Bert had completed the washing-up and rinsed his
big hands in clean water.  He stood wiping them on
the roller-towel, looking down upon her, so sudden a
dilation in his heart and throat that for a space he was
unable to articulate.  He had forgotten the party in the
room beyond as though it never existed.
</p>

<p>
"Millie, let me take yer!  Marry me, Millie, and let's
cut an' run together.  Oh ... you don' know how
good I could be to yer!  Millie, little woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Drop it, Bert Mestaer!  I can't stand it," gasped
the girl, dragging herself to her feet.  "You're always
the same, if ever I trust myself with you for a minute
alone.  Why can't you hold your tongue?"
</p>

<p>
"Hold my tongue, an' lose you?  Why, what d'you
s'pose I got ter live for?" he cried out, stung through
and through by the idea of his own impotence, his utter
failure to arouse one spark of feeling in the girl.
</p>

<p>
He was shaking from head to foot.  It seemed so
enraging, so absurd, that he, whose great strength could
compel this frail creature to anything, absolutely dare
not touch her&mdash;was reduced to stammering, humiliated
silence, by her unconcealed disdain.  It always came to
this between them.  He stood, fighting his feeling, facing
the blank wall of her indifference, when there was a
sudden increase of sound from the scene of the revels&mdash;a
door opened, a furious voice bellowed: "Millie!"
</p>

<p>
It was enough; he was by her side again at once.
Snatching the pile of spoons and forks, he put them
into her apron, picking up a pyramid of plates himself,
and they went back to the supper-room.
</p>

<p>
They were received with a babel of derisive remarks,
the pith of which seemed to be that Millie had been
away with one young man, when she was going to be
married to another.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Millie!" said the deep, guttural voice of
Oom Pieters, rumbling in his hairy throat; "we're
only waiting for you, to drink your health."
</p>

<p>
Since the irruption of diamond-seekers into the
pastoral district, the temperate Boer habits had sadly
altered.  Peach brandy was on the table in generous
quantity, and many of the more old-fashioned sort,
following a bad fashion, had partaken, and not being used to
such things, were not perfectly under their own control.
</p>

<p>
Amurrica was seated on Tante Wilma's right, leaning
back in his tilted chair, and sending out smoke rings
from a mouth which wore a gratified smile.
</p>

<p>
"Goin' to marry Otis," was bandied from lip to lip.
"He's bought a share in the Vierkleur from Maarten
Brandt, and he says, when Millie's a bit fatter she'll do
fine in the bar.  Goin' to sit up together to-night."
</p>

<p>
This in allusion to the old Boer custom which decrees
that an engaged couple shall ratify their troth by sitting
up all night together, and burning candles.
</p>

<p>
"Sh!  Hold your tongue," said Millie, in a low voice
to Bert, who was about to explode.  "They're all drunk;
what's the good of noticing?"
</p>

<p>
"They're all goin' to clear out o' this before I'm much
older," growled Bert, shaking with fury.
</p>

<p>
He broke off; for, to his amazement, Amurrica had
risen, and was calling for silence.
</p>

<p>
As the man stood up, his long, sinewy frame, with a
subtle twist in the carriage, outlined against the dark,
smoky background, swaying slightly on his feet, as a
result of his potations&mdash;the humorous curve on his thin
lips which fascinated women and made Bert hate him&mdash;he
would have made a study for the brush of Franz
Hals.  One thing which the Boers admired about him,
was his mastery of the Taal.  The man was a born
linguist; he chose that language now.
</p>

<p>
He said he had the happiness to announce that he was
the accepted suitor of Miss Lutwyche, and the marriage
was to take place the following day.  "Their esteemed
Predikant"&mdash;then present, and somewhat blear-eyed&mdash;"had
promised to unite them, in view of which festivity,
he invited them all to a supper at the Vierkleur Hotel
to-morrow.  It had been suggested that the English
minister, Mayne, had been left guardian of Miss
Lutwyche.  But this was to be set aside.  If it were so,
he had doubtless obtained such power by exerting undue
influence over the dying man's conscience, and for his
own sinister reasons.  Vrouw Lutwyche was going to law
about it.  But in any case, possession was nine points of
the law, and when he was the husband of Miss Millie he
didn't quite know where the Britisher was coming in;
not into his house, he was almighty sure about that."
</p>

<p>
There was a deep silence all the time he was speaking.
Bert Mestaer stood up motionless, just opposite, behind
the row of seated guests, and Millie stood quite near
him.  He was both hungry and thirsty, and he had,
immediately upon entering, helped himself to coffee
from a big pot on a side-table.  He stood holding the
untasted drink in his hand while he listened to the
unfolding of Amurrica's plot.  The moment he had
finished, before he had time to sit down, Bert flung
the hot contents of his cup full in the orator's face.
</p>

<p>
Amurrica was for the moment blinded by this
unexpected shot.  The coffee streamed down him, into
the bosom of his shirt, and all over his clothes; and the
words he used were not pretty.
</p>

<p>
There was a general stampede; but before the noise
began&mdash;before the men took up the shout for a fight&mdash;even
before Amurrica began to swear&mdash;Bert's ear had
caught a sound that was to him like the bugle to a
war-horse; the short, musical sound of Millie's applauding
laugh.
</p>

<p>
He turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night!" he said.  "We'll soon settle the
question of his sitting up to-night or getting married
to-morrow; and Mayne'll be back the day after.  But
listen to what I say; keep out of Tante Wilma's way
to-night."
</p>

<p>
She gave her usual contemptuous answer: "I'm not
afraid."
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "but I am."
</p>

<p>
It was in his heart to plead for something to hearten
him for the fray, if it were only a hand-shake; but he
forebore.  She should not be able to say again that he
claimed a price for serving her.
</p>

<p>
He strode out radiantly to the battle.  He was
perfectly sober, and had a white heat of passion to
inspire him.  Amurrica, though usually a formidable
adversary, had eaten heavily, and drunk too much.
When they had taken away his revolver, he was an
easy prey.  Bert's object was to put him out of the
running for the next few days, but not to injure him
seriously.  He went into the thing scientifically, and it
was a sorry-looking object which was finally carried off
the field by its backers; while the two great Lutwyche
boys, who had been eager spectators of the fray, ran
back home as fast as they could, to tell their mother
what had chanced.
</p>

<p>
The victor was pleased, but gory.  It was imperative
that he should go to his own place and change.
Amurrica was settled for the present, he had warned
Millie, and felt that he might now give himself an hour
or two off duty without anxiety.  All the way home he
was wondering to himself how Amurrica had known
that Mayne was going away.
</p>

<p>
Anna, who had not been bidden to the revels at
Lutwyche's, was in an evil temper, and said she had
provided no supper.  Hadn't he had his bellyful down
there, where all the swine were swilling?  Bert turned
upon her, with the flame in his eye, the gall on his
tongue, which everybody feared.  She would wish, a
week hence, he told her, when she found herself bundled
out to get her own living, that she had kept a civil
tongue in her head.  Then he went and washed himself
elaborately clean, and put on a clean shirt&mdash;an English
superstition which he had inherited from his mother,
with other vain observances which filled Anna with
contempt.  He had neither eaten nor drunk since
morning, and he knew that, if he was to mount guard
at Lutwyche's till late at night, he must fortify himself.
As he sat at table, the door open, devouring cold meat
and bread, he saw something move behind the fence.
He watched steadfastly until the thing rose more fully
into view, revealed itself as the tow head and flushed
face of one of the small Lutwyches, beckoned him
furtively, and disappeared again.
</p>

<p>
Bert got up and went out.  He looked down over
the fence, and said "Hullo!"  His heart meanwhile
misgave him.
</p>

<p>
The child, grinning up at him, said she had a message
from sister Millie, and she was to give it to him his very
own self.  The message was: "Would he meet Millie at
the sign-post corner at nine o'clock that evening?"  She
was to take back word.
</p>

<p>
"What's she want to do there?" asked Bert
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"She wouldn't say; but I expect she wants to run
away.  Mother she's promised her a hiding."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll go to your mother with the tale."
</p>

<p>
"No fear; I'm on Millie's side."
</p>

<p>
Bert thought a while carefully.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" he said, after a minute.  "Tell her I'll
be there."
</p>

<p>
"Certain sure?"
</p>

<p>
"That's me."  The tow head nodded and disappeared.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
IN THE GARRET
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "I met a lady in the meads,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full beautiful, a fairy's child;<br>
  Her hair was long, her foot was light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her eyes were wild."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;JOHN KEATS.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Bert stood where he was, rooted in deep thought,
watching the child as she ran away.  He did not
believe that what she said was true.  Millie might very
probably plot to escape, but she would never send him
word to bear her company.  Besides, he knew that she
did not intend to run away until she heard the result
of her father's message to her English relatives.  He
wondered that anybody should think such a device
could impose upon him.  It was a hoax, and its obvious
object was to get him out of the way.  What devilry
was Tante Wilma plotting?
</p>

<p>
He laughed a little; they thought him easily deceived.
</p>

<p>
A moment's reflection convinced him that the child's
message was part of a preconceived arrangement with
Amurrica.  But he felt sure that, after his handling of
the subject, the prospective bridegroom would be
unable to take his part in anything that night.  He
looked at the clock, which pointed to seven, and made
up his mind that he would resume his sentry duty at
Lutwyche's about eight.  Anticipating a long wait, he
thrust a sandwich into his pocket and a flask of spirits,
and sallied forth to stroll down the town, and hear what
was being said of the fight and the funeral.
</p>

<p>
The main street was thronged with people.  For a
minute it made him a little anxious.  If the town
meant to take up the feud, and back Otis, things might
be a trifle strained, though there were some of the men
on whom he thought he could rely as backers.
</p>

<p>
But he soon saw that there was a deeper preoccupation
on the faces of the burghers.  The fight, which
in calmer times would have filled men's mouths for a
week, was forgotten.  The flag floating over the Post
Office showed him that the weekly mail was in; and
knowing the political tension, he guessed that there was
news.  He dashed into the Vierkleur.  It was a babel
of tongues.  Men were fighting for possession of the
newspapers; those who had letters or journals from
Pretoria were being besieged in corners.  For the
moment, the remembrance of Millie faded from Bert's
mind, as he mingled with the throng, and gathered first
of all the main fact, that the British Government had
ordered the immediate despatch of troops, both from
England and India, to back up the demand for the
Outland Franchise.  Debate was keen as to whether
the British Government would really fight.
</p>

<p>
The madness of conflict rose in Bert's blood as in that
of all the men there.  They shouted, argued, wrangled,
drank, swore.  At whatever cost, Bert felt he must get
at the main facts of the position, and he listened while
one of the men, perched on the bar, read aloud leading
articles from English and Boer journals, and the talk
hummed and buzzed more busily than ever.
</p>

<p>
He was recalled from his absorption by a touch on
his shoulder.  Cornelis Pieters, the field-cornet, stood
by, regarding him with no friendly glance.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky for you the Commandos are to be called
out; nobody will have time to set the law on you," he
growled.  "Otis is goin' to die."
</p>

<p>
"We're all going to die&mdash;some day," said Bert placidly.
</p>

<p>
"He's goin' on ahead," said Pieters surlily.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not taking any," returned Bert, unmoved.  "I
had the cooking of him, and I know what I done to
him.  He won't be gettin' married just yet a while; but
he's all right."
</p>

<p>
"If Tante Wilma takes my advice, she'll give that
girl a taste of the stick," rumbled Pieters.  "A taller
dip 'ud make as good a wife as her, to my way o'
thinkin'; an' when a man that could stomach her comes
along, you must needs knock him out o' time.  It wasn't
your affair.  There'll be a reckoning, I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Hope so," retorted Bert.  "Couldn't live in this
township, if you didn't believe the right 'ud come up
some day.  So long!"
</p>

<p>
"Where are you off to?"
</p>

<p>
"To see as Tante Wilma don't lay a finger on the gal."
</p>

<p>
"From what I heard, before I came away, I shouldn't
be surprised if you was too late," said Pieters, grinning
in his face.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was quite dark when he arrived at the gate of
Lutwyche's.
</p>

<p>
He was panting with the speed he had used, and the
sweat ran down him.  He was blaming himself bitterly
because in the excitement of the war news he had lost
sight of his purpose; and it was more than half-past
eight.  To his untold joy and relief, the first thing he
saw was the light glimmering through Millie's square of
ground glass in the loft.  His heart leapt, and the strain
of his muscles relaxed.  He halted outside the gate,
wiped his brow, and listened with all his might.  All
was quiet.  But there was one unusual thing.  Lights
were burning in the <i>sitkamer</i>, a most rare phenomenon
in a pastoral Boer district, where everybody rises and
goes to bed with the sun.  This looked as though it
were still planned that the sitting-up should take place
that night.  He carefully unfastened the hurdle gate
and went into the yard.  By degrees he drew nearer
the house.  Half-way across, a sound made itself
audible&mdash;the thudding of a hammer against wood.  It went on
with monotonous regularity, but his fears sprang up
anew at the sound.  What were they doing?
</p>

<p>
He walked right up to the stoep, raised himself to a
level with the window-sill, and through a gap between
the edge of the blind and the window frame, could see
right into the <i>sitkamer</i>.  What were they doing?
</p>

<p>
Tante Wilma, like some unclean beast, stood balancing
herself unsteadily against the table, her face purple, her
eyes wild, a sjambok in her hand.  The children were
all clustered round the foot of the ladder leading to the
loft, and the eldest boy was standing upon it, aiming
clumsy, childish blows with a big hammer at the
trapdoor above his head.
</p>

<p>
Ha!  Then he was just in time, and only just!
Lord!  When the bolt gave way, they should find
someone they did not look for, in the loft above!
</p>

<p>
The blood surged to Bert's head&mdash;he set his teeth.
With stealthy tread he crept to the barn, found a
ladder&mdash;his late vigils about the farm had taught him where
most things were kept&mdash;and setting it against the low
house wall, he lightly ascended to the roof.
</p>

<p>
The window was slightly open&mdash;secured by means of
an iron bar with holes in it.  It was not wide enough to
enable him to see in.  The blows continued upon the
trap below, showing that the besiegers had not yet
forced an entrance.  The noise drowned the sound of his
voice, and he ventured to call gently: "Millie!  Millie!"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  He called again, a little louder.
</p>

<p>
All was silent in the garret; he could not hear the
least rustling.  The idea that she was not there, after
all, but hiding away somewhere in safety, made his
heart dance.  Suppose she really had run away, and
was waiting for him at the cross-roads?  It was most
unlikely, but it was not impossible; one never could be
sure of girls.  Meantime, he must ascertain before that
bolt gave.  Putting in his hand, he lifted the window as
high as it would go&mdash;high enough to enable him to put
his head under it.  The loft extended a good way,
though only just in the centre, under the pitch of the
roof, was it high enough to stand upright in.  It was a
pitiful sleeping-chamber for a girl.
</p>

<p>
The little camp bed was smooth and empty.  He
could not see Millie anywhere.  A candle stood upon
a deal chest, guttering in the draught, showing the void
space and the neatness of the dreary lodging.
</p>

<p>
She was actually gone, then?  He drew a deep
breath....
</p>

<p>
Something had caught his eye&mdash;a red, wet mess on
the bare boards, close to the trap-door.  All round this
was a series of smears, and another blotch, almost a pool
... and some big drops, dotted along the floor into the
darkness, under the low part of the roof, where the
coffins and the fruit were stored.
</p>

<p>
Bert became a tiger.  One wrench of his iron wrists
brought the skylight off its hinges, and without noise
he swung himself down into the garret.  Stooping, he
assured himself that the iron bolt of the trap-door
would stand a good deal more of such battering as it
was now enduring before it gave way.  Then he seized
the candle, and crept along the trail of the blood-stains.
</p>

<p>
He soon found her; and at first he thought that she
was dead.  She was lying prone upon the ground, her
head sunk sideways, all dabbled in blood.  One arm
lay so curiously twisted that he guessed it to be broken.
Bending over her, he heard her breathe; and then, raising
her as tenderly as he could, found with mingled fury
and relief that all the bleeding came from her lacerated
shoulders.  She had been inhumanly thrashed.  Her
clothes were literally torn off her back.
</p>

<p>
With indomitable pride she had crept up here to die
alone.
</p>

<p>
It did not take Bert an instant to consider what he
should do.  He snatched a sheet from the bed, wrapped
it round and round the raw, bleeding back, then
possessed himself of the dark woollen coverlet, and rolled
the slight, unresisting form therein.  Lifting her as
easily as one might a child, he carried her to the
skylight, managed, with the help of a broken chair, to
get her and himself through it, and in a moment was
descending the ladder, clasping all the happiness the
world held for him in his arms, his whole heart one
white flame of pity and indignation.

CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "She took me to her elfin grot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there she gazed and sighéd deep,<br>
  And there I shut her sad, wild eyes&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So kissed to sleep.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  "... And I awoke, and found me here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cold hillside."<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Rapid transit through the night air, and the pain of her
open wounds, brought back consciousness to Millie.
</p>

<p>
She was light and small, but for all that, she was
some weight to carry far; and when she began to writhe
and twist in his hold, Bert was obliged to call a halt.
He sat down, after a few ineffectual attempts to soothe
her, on a hummock of ground by the roadside, cradling
her as easily as he could upon his knees.
</p>

<p>
"What's happened?  What's happened?" she began
to stammer, evidently not quite knowing what she said.
"It's dark! it's dark!  Light the candle, one of
you! ... O-o-oh!"
</p>

<p>
It was a long-drawn wail of agony.
</p>

<p>
Bert was very white.  His heart was hammering, but
the heat and wild rage of the past half-hour had passed
away, and now he was all gathered into himself like a
coiled spring.  Everything, he believed, hung upon his
ability to make the most of this chance, this hour that
he had snatched for himself.  The awkward self-consciousness
which held him, as a rule, tongue-tied before
her, was clean gone; only the concentrated force of his
will remained.
</p>

<p>
Drawing his flask from his pocket, he poured out
some raw spirit shakily, his left arm supporting the
girl's head in the crook of the elbow.  He administered
a mouthful.  She gasped, and refused more; but she
had swallowed it.  He waited a moment, with outward
composure, and then said quietly:
</p>

<p>
"Millie, d'you know me?"
</p>

<p>
She started, and began to struggle in his hold.
</p>

<p>
"It's Bert," he said steadily; and to his unfeigned
and stupefying astonishment, her struggles ceased.
</p>

<p>
"I thought&mdash;'twas Otis," she whispered, so low that
he could hardly hear.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's not," he murmured, trembling; "it's me.
Listen!  You've been cruel knocked about&mdash;d'you
hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the&mdash;old&mdash;woman&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know, my girl, I know!  I got up through the
roof, an' fetched you away.  You're safe now; there's
only me.  D'you understand?"
</p>

<p>
There came an almost incredible whisper: "They said
you'd gone away ... to the cross-roads..."
</p>

<p>
One short laugh of triumph escaped him.
</p>

<p>
"No fear," he murmured consolingly.  "I was on
hand.  I'm going to take you to my place, and get
you fixed up, and fetch the doctor to you.  But look
here, Millie, it'll make folks talk.  Jus' say you'll marry
me, an' that'll set things right.  That'll give a reason
why I should be looking after you."
</p>

<p>
He paused, his ear almost at her lips, straining for her
reply.
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' to die," she whispered at last.  He barely
heard.
</p>

<p>
"Well, till you die, can't I look after you, Millie?"
</p>

<p>
"If you like," murmured Millie indifferently, as she
lapsed again into stupor.
</p>

<p>
William the Conqueror, crowned king of England,
after desperate and apparently foolhardy invasion, felt
perhaps much the same emotions as coursed through
Bert Mestaer, sitting there in the dark, by the wayside,
the half-dead form of a half-grown girl upon his
knees.
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyes to the star-gleam above them,
and emotions hitherto unknown laid hands upon him,
thrilling his nerve-centres with a triumph that was
almost agony.  A long minute elapsed before he
could collect himself enough to rise and continue his
journey.  No amount of guardians, no letters from
England, he told himself, could take her from him
now.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday he had practically no hopes, only a
dogged determination not to give in.  To-night he
was master of the world.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Anna was not a good-tempered woman, but neither
was she an inhuman one.  She was very angry at being
aroused by Bert out of her first sleep; but she detected
something unusual in his manner.
</p>

<p>
"I got something to show you downstairs in the
parlour," he said, "an' when you've seen it, I don't
much fancy you'll want to go to bed again."
</p>

<p>
So she lumbered down the stairs, and into the little
parlour which had been Mrs. Mestaer's pride; and on
the ample sofa, among the blood-stained linen, lay
what she took to be the corpse of Millie Lutwyche.
</p>

<p>
"You got to help me make her swallow some
brandy," he said, "and then you got to do what you
can for her while I gallop for Dr. Fraser; but don't
you meddle with that arm, because it's dislocated."
</p>

<p>
"Vrouw Lutwyche's carving?" asked Anna, with venom.
</p>

<p>
"That's it," returned Bert, pouring the brandy.
</p>

<p>
"Drunken sow!  I hope you see now, Hubert, where
it is the drink leads to."
</p>

<p>
"I see!  I'm going to swear off drink for ever now."
</p>

<p>
"She's past brandy," said Anna, hanging over the
prostrate girl.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" said Bert shortly; and he managed to
make her swallow a table-spoonful.  "Anna," he said,
"you shall have a silk gown on my wedding-day."
</p>

<p>
"If you're going to marry a willow-shaving, may the
day never dawn," said Anna tartly.
</p>

<p>
But she handled the misused girl tenderly enough,
for hers was a maternal heart, though soured by
spinsterhood; and Bert, when he saw her set about it, turned
away with haste to the stable.
</p>

<p>
Before setting out on his long ride, he came back to
warn Anna not to admit anybody on any pretext while
he was away; and arranged that when he returned
with the doctor he would give a certain number of
signal taps upon the window.
</p>

<p>
Then, springing to the saddle, he dashed away
through the night, his wild heart drumming to the
music of the flying hoofs, and his imaginings soaring
to the purple velvet dome of heaven.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE SCANDALISING OF SLABBERT'S POORT
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Priests<br>
  Should study passion; how else cure mankind,<br>
  Who come for help in passionate extremes?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ROBERT BROWNING (Caponsacchi).<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Carol Mayne got back to the Mission on the
afternoon of the second day after this, he was told
that Oom Pieters and the Boer Predikant were waiting
to see him.
</p>

<p>
The news they brought fairly staggered him.
</p>

<p>
Bert Mestaer had, during the night after the funeral,
forced an entrance into Lutwyche's and abducted Millie.
That he had done this by force was evident from the
blood-stained floor of her garret and the evidences of
a struggle, the bedding being torn and scattered about.
He had taken her to his own house, and kept her there,
in defiance of all Christian laws, to the crying scandal
of the whole community.  Oom Pieters had been
insulted when he went to remonstrate; and the
Predikant, who, at his urgent entreaty, had gone to
warn the headstrong girl of the penalties of living in
sin, had been literally, not metaphorically, kicked off
the premises by the lawless ravisher.  Putting things
together, they would have been inclined to fear that
the girl had actually been made away with, but for
the assurance of Anna to the contrary.  They thought
that heavy drinking must be the cause of Bert's
outrageous behaviour, since he had picked a quarrel with
Otis earlier in the evening, and so mishandled him that
he had been unable to appear in public since.
</p>

<p>
Horrible as the news was, Mayne, knowing the
violence of Bert's passion, his fear that Millie was to be
taken away, and his intemperate habits, felt it possible
that a great part of what he heard might be true.  His
disappointment was keen.  He had looked for better
things from Mestaer, whom he liked better than anyone
else in Slabbert's Poort; and the behaviour now
attributed to him was that of a wild beast.  He hurried
off without rest or refreshment to the High Farm; and
all the way he was trying to piece the story together&mdash;to
think how the lover who had always been so tongue-tied
and shamefaced, could possibly have proceeded to
such lengths; and the more he reflected, the more he
felt sure that he had heard a perverted version of what
had really happened.
</p>

<p>
But when he neared the white house, with its pleasant
green shutters, his fears became acute; for the owner
was leaning over the little garden gate, and one glance
at his face showed that he was inflamed with triumph.
He had evidently been gathering flowers; his hands
were full of them; the fact impressed the new-comer
much as though he had seen a lion sitting down to tea
in a lady's drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Bert was dressed with scrupulous care; his linen was
fresh.  He looked ten years older; had graduated from
boy to man in two days.  There was a steady blaze in
his eyes; his mouth wore a defiant curve.  The exaltation
and triumph of his aspect affected Mayne strongly.
But no look of guilt or remorse crossed his handsome
face at sight of the approaching guardian.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" he frankly cried; "come in!  Things have
hummed since you went away."
</p>

<p>
Mayne stiffened in fierce wrath.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer," he said, keeping himself calm with
difficulty, "tell me that this I have heard of you is a
slander&mdash;tell me that Millie Lutwyche is not here!"
</p>

<p>
Bert's eyes flamed.
</p>

<p>
"Millie Lutwyche is here," he cried, "and what's
more, she'll stay here.  Didn't you leave it to me to see
she wasn't murdered?  Well, I managed it, but only
just."
</p>

<p>
Mayne came in through the gate and walked into
the house.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard one side of the story," he said.  "It's
only fair that I should hear yours."
</p>

<p>
Bert followed him in.  His style was abrupt but
convincing.  He told how Amurrica and Tante Wilma
had tried to steal a march on Mayne, and how the
Predikant had been willing to aid and abet.  He told
how he had foiled this plan, how he had been sent a
message to decoy him out of the way, how he had gone
down to the farm, but too late to prevent violence.  He
told how he had brought Millie home, and at once
called in Dr. Fraser, who could corroborate all he said.
He spoke without eagerness, and with an underlying
confidence in his voice which showed how sure he felt
of his position.
</p>

<p>
"If ever a man earned a woman fair, I done it," he
remarked simply.  "She's better to-day; but Dr. Fraser
was a bit afraid of collapse at first.  Anna's nursed her.
I've not been near, except just to pass the time of day.
I done the square thing, as I told you all along I
meant to; an' we'll come to church an' get married,
soon as she's up and dressed."
</p>

<p>
Mayne slowly shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer," he said, "I have done you an injustice, I
freely own it.  I believe all you tell me.  You have
done better than I thought you would; now it remains
for you to do better than you yourself believe that you
can.  You must let Millie go."
</p>

<p>
Bert flung himself into a chair, and pulling out a
tobacco-pouch, began to fill his pipe.  He gave an
insolent laugh.
</p>

<p>
"We're engaged; you can't alter that."
</p>

<p>
"Under the terms of her father's will, Millie cannot
marry under the age of twenty-one without my consent
She is going to England."
</p>

<p>
Bert looked earnestly at him.
</p>

<p>
"Look here!  I've played the game so far," he said.
"Don't you push me; you'd better not.  Hands off
Millie; she's going to marry me."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she may, when she is grown up, if you
have the courage and constancy to wait for her; but
not now."
</p>

<p>
"Now, by &mdash;&mdash;!"  His oath made Carol wince.
</p>

<p>
He sat for a minute in complete silence and close
thought; then he rose.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see Millie, if she is awake," he said,
very quietly.
</p>

<p>
Bert looked at him piercingly.  Had there been one
shade of arrogance in his tone, or had he seemed to
suggest that he doubted Bert's assent, there might have
been open war.  But he gave no handle; and the
master of the house, after a very brief hesitation, rose
and tapped at the parlour door.
</p>

<p>
Anna peeped out, and admitted them, with an
anxious glance from one face to the other.  Mayne
walked in, and Bert followed him, with his bunch of
flowers in his hand.
</p>

<p>
The waxen-white Millie lay with her flaxen hair
loose upon the pillows.  Her eyes were wide open, and
flashed restlessly.  Her whole mien otherwise was so
still that one would have hardly thought her living.  A
look of expectancy kindled for a moment upon her
face when she saw Mayne, but it soon died down.
</p>

<p>
He went over and sat down by her, with the
naturalness of manner which frequent visits to
sick-chambers give to the priest.  Bert felt a pang of envy;
he himself was so completely a fish out of water.
</p>

<p>
"I am grieved indeed to hear of the way you have
been treated," said Mayne gently.  "Poor girl!  I wish
you had gone away to Leitersdorp as I suggested."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," said Millie, under her breath.
</p>

<p>
"You thought yourself so secure," he went on
regretfully, looking at her bandaged arm.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm paying for it," said the girl distinctly,
"and got to go on doing that all the rest of my life,
so I hear."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hope not!  You will be all right in a few
weeks," he assured her hopefully.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said she, "but he's got to be paid, you
see, for what he did."  She raised her uninjured arm
and pointed to Bert, who turned scarlet as he stood
awkwardly dandling his flowers.  "Men don't help you
for nothing; I've found out that much," she said, with
biting intention.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you do Mestaer injustice," said Mayne
quietly.  "No Englishman could possibly ask anything
in return for the privilege of helping a woman."
</p>

<p>
"He says," said Millie, "that I promised to marry
him the night he brought me here.  I don't remember;
but if I did, I got to do it, I s'pose."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not!" was the emphatic reply.  "Get rid
of that idea.  No man worthy of the name could hold
you to a promise made under such circumstances.
Besides, you are not free to marry for the next five
years.  Don't you want to go to England?"
</p>

<p>
The living blood flooded the white face with lovely
colour; the eyes flashed fire.
</p>

<p>
"May I?  Could I?" she gasped, half raising herself
among her pillows, her face transformed with an energy,
a desire for life, most strikingly at variance with her
lethargy of a few minutes before.  "Have they written?
Do they want me?"
</p>

<p>
He drew a letter from his coat-pocket.  "They have
written, and they do want you," he said.
</p>

<p>
She sat quite up, unsupported.  "Read it!  Read it!"
</p>

<p>
Bert stood still as a stone, while Mayne unfolded a
sheet of paper, written in a small, niggling, but cultivated
hand, and read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"FRANSDALE VICARAGE, CLEVESHIRE.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Sir,&mdash;I am in receipt of your letter, and note
that my brother-in-law, Arnold Lutwyche, is dying, and
leaving my niece, Melicent, only daughter of my late
sister, wholly unprovided for.  I also note that you
consider her Boer step-mother is not a fit person to
have the charge of her, and is likely to treat her ill.
</p>

<p>
"Under these circumstances, my duty seems clear, and
my wife and I have no hesitation in directing you to
send my niece to England by the earliest available boat,
and we will give her a home for the present.
</p>

<p>
"At the same time, I must acquaint you with the fact
that our means are small, and we have seven children of
our own, so that Melicent will be under the necessity of
making herself useful.
</p>

<p>
"Please send her by the cheapest line of boats, and
notify me of her arrival.  I fear that I shall not be able
to come to London to meet her, but if she is fifteen or
sixteen years old, she should be able to make her way
to us as far as the railway will bring her&mdash;that is to say,
to Birdmore Junction, where she shall be met.
</p>

<p>
"I note that my brother's estate will be sufficient to
meet her travelling expenses, so conclude that no
advance from me is necessary.
</p>

<p>
"With thanks to you for the trouble you take in the
matter, and remembrances to Mr. Lutwyche, should this
letter find him still alive.&mdash;I am, very faithfully yours,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"EDMUND CHETWYND-COOPER."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter had chilled Mayne by its formal coldness.
No love was sent to the orphan, no message of welcome.
But the frigidity of the style made apparently no
difference to Millie.  The great fact was there.  Her
way to England lay open, her destination fixed.  Of all
safe shelters, a remote English vicarage should have
satisfied her guardian.  But somehow, to Carol, the
idea of Miss Lutwyche in such a situation, was not
convincing.  He could not see her in the part, as actors
say.
</p>

<p>
No such doubts troubled her.  For the very first
time since Mayne had known her, her face beamed
and sparkled with joy.
</p>

<p>
"I can be ready to travel soon," she cried.  "In a
fortnight&mdash;in ten days&mdash;ask the doctor!"
</p>

<p>
Bert made three strides across the room, hurling with
violence the flowers he carried into the English grate.
</p>

<p>
"So you'll break your word," he began, and choked
</p>

<p>
Melicent turned her head towards him languidly.
</p>

<p>
"Bert Mestaer," said she, "have I ever once, since
you knew me, said one word to make you think I liked
you?"
</p>

<p>
He fought with himself for composure to enable him
to bring out the monosyllable, "No."
</p>

<p>
"Then what d'you wanter marry me for?" she asked
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"You know," he cried, terribly, wildly, in his frantic
emotion.  "You know I love you&mdash;you know I don't
care for anything else, but just to have you!  Where'd
you be now, if it wasn't for me?  Tell me that!  I wish
to God I'd never seen you!  I'll&mdash;I'll kill you with my
own hands before I'll let you go now!  I'll do
worse&mdash;I'll..."
</p>

<p>
He stopped himself suddenly, meeting the steady
contempt of Mayne's eyes.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of awful silence, broken only by
two dry, tearing sobs from the furious lover; then
Millie, who had turned chalk-white once more, fell back
among her pillows with an impatient motion of the
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, get away; you make me sick," she said.
</p>

<p>
Before Bert could speak or move, Mayne went up to
him, took him by the arm, and led him out of the room.
Then, handing him his hat, he drew him as passively
out of the house.
</p>

<p>
Neither spoke till they had walked half a mile.
Mayne was half in fear that Bert, in his rage, might
set upon him bodily, and congratulated himself, not
for the first time in his missionary career, upon the
possession of thews and sinews.  But no ebullition
came.  Bert's face had gone grey, and he looked worn
and shrunken in the strong sunlight.
</p>

<p>
At last, smitten by the despair in his altered manner,
the elder man ventured to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Mestaer, you must come and put up at my place till
Miss Lutwyche is well enough to travel.  You did the
best you could for her&mdash;you did well; but the strain is
too great, and it must cease.  I shall wire for one of the
Sisters from Leitersdorp to come and help Anna to
nurse her.  As to you, you have to fight and win a
man's hardest battle; and I'll give you a bit of
advice&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go to h&mdash; with your advice!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not far away now, to judge by the sulphur in
the atmosphere," retorted Mayne drily, and said no
more.
</p>

<p>
They walked on until they came to the little Mission,
and turned in to the sparsely-furnished living-room,
with its crucifix and Albrecht Dürer <i>fac-similes</i>, and
the Da Vinci Virgin on the rude mantel.
</p>

<p>
Bert walked across the room, planted both elbows on
the shelf, and stared with blank eyes at the ineffable
smile of the pictured face.  Suddenly he wheeled
round.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's your blasted advice?" he said rudely.
"A black-coated prig that doesn't know what it means
to be..."
</p>

<p>
"Tempted," suggested Mayne drily.  But he pushed
a chair for his discourteous guest, and got down the
tobacco-jar.  "No man can fight the flesh and win, if
he's living in idleness," he said reflectively, standing
before the hearth and filling his pipe.  "But there's
another consideration.  Do you realise that we are on
the brink of war?"
</p>

<p>
"Kruger, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Steyn, too.  You heard the news the other day?
All the men ordered out on commando.  What
does that mean?  The Orange Free State is going in
against England."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they can fight their own blank battles without
my help."
</p>

<p>
"That's rubbish, Mestaer.  You'll have to fight on
one side or the other.  Now is the time to show yourself
an Englishman.  England wants men.  They think at
home that this war is to be a walk over.  You and I
know better.  Go and enlist.  There's a career for
you."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be d&mdash;d if I do."
</p>

<p>
"That's a condition that seems to me far more likely
to supervene if you don't," was the temperate reply.
</p>

<p>
Bert laid down his miserable head upon his arms.
</p>

<p>
"You don't see, and I can't explain," he said haltingly,
"that it's not a thing&mdash;not a question of what you call
the flesh.  If there's such a thing as spirit anywhere in
me, I've put it all in my love for her.  If you take her
away, I shall go to the devil."
</p>

<p>
"If I take her away!  My dear chap, you cannot
seriously mean to pretend that you think Millie wants
to marry you?"
</p>

<p>
Sulky silence.
</p>

<p>
"I know you better than to believe you would be cad
enough to marry her against her will.  Were you to do
so, I fail to see in what respect you would be any better
than Otis."
</p>

<p>
No reply.
</p>

<p>
Mayne stood up, searching his book-shelves for the
"Divina Commedia."
</p>

<p>
"Bert, did you ever hear of Dante?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Nobody as lives hereabouts, is he?"
</p>

<p>
Mayne did not smile.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you something of him&mdash;how all his life he lived
for the memory of a dead woman&mdash;a woman of whom
he knew even less than you know of Millie, and lived
in hope, and cleanly, for her sake.  Now, Millie is not
dead.  You are but a boy, and she a girl.  Five or six
or seven years hence, if you make a career for yourself
what is to prevent you from trying again?  By that
time she would at least realise the enduring nature of
your love; whereas now, neither you nor I nor she could
say that it will last.  It is just a boy's hot flame."
</p>

<p>
Bert stamped.
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe me capable of it," he stormed.
"You just think that if you can get her out of my way
now, that'll be the end of it all.  You don't think I've
the manhood or the pluck to stick to the thing through
years of absence&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, staring at the kindled face of the priest,
who had risen, and stood facing him.
</p>

<p>
"That's just where you make your mistake, Bert,"
said his friend earnestly.  "I do believe you capable
of the best.  Listen!  When I came first to Slabbert's
Poort, I found you a loafer.  You were idle and
good-for-nothing and intemperate.  Now you have shown me
what you are capable of.  Your love for Millie has made
you a different man.  You have fought for her, saved
her, respected her! ... I rather wish you had heard
tell of one Caponsacchi; but never mind.  It's better
to do knightly deeds than to read about 'em.  Anyhow,
you have set your foot on the road to become a true
gentleman; why turn back now?  Hubert Mestaer"&mdash;his
voice took on the deep note it sometimes had in
the pulpit&mdash;"by the memory of your mother, I ask you,
why turn back now?"

CHAPTER X
<br><br>
FRANSDALE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Ankle-deep in English grass I leaped,<br>
  And clapped my hands, and called all very fair."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was mid-October.  St.  Luke's summer brooded over
the solitary acres of heather, which crowned the hills
that flung encradling arms about Fransdale.
</p>

<p>
The golden bracken was turning brown, but the
heather still carried its glory of purple.  The woodlands
were forsaking their devotion to pure green, and
rioted in every hue of red and yellow, and the light air
sang and hummed about the uplands of the glorious
land.  All the summer had been fine; the becks had
sunk to musical murmurings; one might walk from
Tod's Trush to the Three Howes, across country,
without getting bogged.
</p>

<p>
In a stable-yard surrounded by grey stone
out-buildings stood the Reverend Edmund Chetwynd-Cooper,
harnessing his horse to the dog-cart.  Near
him a big, loose-limbed, clumsy girl, who had evidently
outgrown her strength, stood listlessly watching him
through half-shut eyes.
</p>

<p>
"How old is Cousin Melicent?" she asked, in a voice
which always sounded fretful.
</p>

<p>
"I have told you I believe her to be about sixteen."
</p>

<p>
"Nearly as old as I am.  I wonder whether we shall
like her?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope you understood what I said at dinner-time.
There is to be no intimacy until we have decided that
Melicent is a fit companion for you.  No intimacy,
mind."
</p>

<p>
His voice was even and quiet, low-pitched and
cultivated.  He was a handsome, dark man, with
regular features, and a cold, blue eye; clean shaven
but for a straight line of black whisker down each
cheek, which made him look vaguely out of date.
</p>

<p>
His daughter looked at him with a sidelong glance.
</p>

<p>
"All right, father," she said, in a kind of formula,
adding, in an injured tone: "I should have thought
you might take one of us to meet her."
</p>

<p>
"I do not know what luggage there may be."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cooper would not have said, "I don't know," for
the world; and the fact was typical of his extreme
correctness.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your mother?" he asked, when the last
strap was adjusted.  "I promised her a lift as far as the
Mill.  Go, Madeline, and tell her I am ready."
</p>

<p>
The girl slouched away, with a bored expression;
and the parson, having fetched the dust-rug and whip,
walked the mare out of the yard and up to the door of
the square, uncompromising grey stone Vicarage.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could have been finer than the prospect.
The church and Vicarage stood near the head of the
Dale, close to the bolder, wilder, more heathery part,
and looked down on the valleyland, the trout stream
and rich meadows below.  The minutes ticked on, while
the vicar waited.  Presently Madeline emerged.
</p>

<p>
"Mother says she won't be long."
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell her please, that I positively must start
in five minutes."
</p>

<p>
The girl disappeared.  The five minutes elapsed;
three more passed.  The vicar got into the trap.
Madeline once more appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Mother thinks, before she starts, she had better give
Bee a dose of her tonic."
</p>

<p>
"Then tell her I am off without her.  The train will
not wait, even for your mother."
</p>

<p>
He was just going out of the gate, when a window-sash
was raised, and a voice cried:
</p>

<p>
"Aidmund!  Aidmund!"
</p>

<p>
He checked the horse.
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Come if you are ready," he said, quite
temperately, his voice showing no annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I can't do that; but I thought it would be
so capital if you could get me one or two things in
Birdmore?  I shan't be very long writing them down."
</p>

<p>
"You should have thought of that before."
</p>

<p>
"My darling boy, think how busy I have been all this
morning, preparing&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The rest was lost, for the vicar had driven away.
His cold eyes were quite gentle, but he did draw in his
breath sharply once; at the thought, perhaps, of this
helpmeet of his, in this remote village, where nothing
ever interrupted her simple routine of duties&mdash;incapable
of being ready for a drive at three o'clock in the
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The old mare had to step out.  Mrs. Cooper had
succeeded in making her husband ten minutes late;
and nine miles of very bad road lay between him and
the Junction.  The train which was to bring his niece
was just coming to a standstill in the little wayside
station, as the old mare, conscious of having been
hustled, trotted into the station-yard.
</p>

<p>
The vicar hastened through the booking-office, out
upon the asphalte platform, whereon a small, slender
girl in black stood lonely beside some solid-looking
packing-cases and one modest trunk.  She wore her
left arm in a sling.  He came slowly forward, with a
resolute smile of greeting on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Melicent?"
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes searchingly to his face.  "Yes,
I am."
</p>

<p>
"You are not at all like your mother," he said,
scanning the pale face.
</p>

<p>
"No; father did not think me like her."
</p>

<p>
"You have managed your journey well?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, thank you, it was all quite easy."
</p>

<p>
"How did you manage last night in London?"
</p>

<p>
"I went home with some people who were kind to
me on the voyage; Mr. and Mrs. Helston."
</p>

<p>
"I expected a taller niece," he said kindly.
</p>

<p>
"I am small for my age, I know."
</p>

<p>
His anxious gaze was fixed upon the packing-cases.
There were three of them, and their bulk suggested
weight.
</p>

<p>
"Do those cases belong to you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; my father's books and valuables.  He left
them all to me, and my guardian insisted that
Mrs. Lutwyche should give them up."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't quite know how they are going to be
conveyed up the Dale," he said, in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," said Millie, with <i>sang-froid</i>.
"Mr. Dow is going to take them in his waggon."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Dow!" ejaculated the vicar, in a tone
compounded of equal parts of astonishment and
displeasure.
</p>

<p>
A big Cleveshire Dalesman, of the more prosperous
type&mdash;handsome, well-dressed, a striking figure in his
riding breeches and gaiters, now approached, lifting his
cap from his fair hair, his eyes twinkling with a kind of
enjoyment which he peculiarly relished.
</p>

<p>
"Your niece and me has been getting acquainted," he
said, in his unrenderable soft-vowelled Dale speech.
"Makin' friends, as you may say."  It sounded more
like: "Mäakin' freänds, as you mäay säa."  But the
phonetic rendering of dialect is a weariness, and will
not here be attempted.  "Fair enjoyin' werselves we've
been, ever since leavin' York Station.  I'm goin' to take
her goods up t' Dale for her, since I expect you've only
t' old mare an't' cart with you, Mr. Cooper."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cooper could barely acknowledge the kindness,
for angry mortification.  He was a Southerner, planted
down among people whom he disliked, because he did
not in the least understand them.  His idea of the
peasant's correct attitude was a servile obedience to the
parson, and that kind of gratitude which is rightly said
to consist of a lively sense of favours to come.  The
sturdy independence, and I'm-as-good-as-you indifference
of the North Country, was a positive offence to him, his
only armour against it being a crust of ever increasing
cold dignity and aloofness, which the Dalesmen saw, and
chuckled over.  His wife, who had come among them,
ready with the ministrations which she understood&mdash;with
condescending smiles, ill-made soup, old clothes
and patronage&mdash;found no market for these
commodities.  A premature exhibition of them had
produced such a condition of feeling, that now, as she
came down the road, full of amiable intentions, the
village became a desert, everyone slipping within doors
and disappearing, sooner than encounter her.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the Dale was full of nonconformity; and
the attitude of the vicar towards dissent was that of
silent, rigid dislike&mdash;of his wife, that kind of shocked
horror with which some people talk of "the heathen."
</p>

<p>
So the Chetwynd-Coopers dwelt as aliens in their
Northern parish, attributing their failure solely to causes
exterior to themselves, and resolutely setting the
advantages of fine moorland air, and the low price of
provisions, against the vague depression which their
isolation naturally caused.
</p>

<p>
But, among all the thorns in the vicar's dignified
flesh, Farmer Dow, of Crow Gate Farm, the leading
Dissenter in the Dale, was the sharpest.  Poor Millie
could not have made a more unfortunate entry upon the
scenes, than under his auspices.  The ice in the vicar's
voice, as he declined his kindness, was obvious to the
bystanders.  But Dow was not to be denied.  He had
promised Millie that her goods should be taken up,
and taken up they should be, that very night.  She had
taught him more about South Africa in half-an-hour
than the newspapers had taught him in half a year.
She was coming to tea with his mother, at Crow Gate,
and going to keep him posted in the war news.  He
owed it to her to see after her baggage, after such
entertainment.  He helped her into the trap with such
<i>empressement</i> that the onlookers were deeply moved;
and the vicar's heart was hot within him as he drove
away.  His niece was, as he had feared, hopelessly
Colonial.
</p>

<p>
But it was not the vicar's habit to speak in anger.
Experience had given him a power of self-control which
would have kindled the admiration of his parishioners,
had they guessed what manner of man lay hidden
under the dry, precise manner.
</p>

<p>
He waited until he had himself well in hand, and
then commenced conversation&mdash;not upon the burning
topic.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to see that you have hurt your arm."
</p>

<p>
Millie, whose eyes were fixed in deep, increasing
interest on the country they were passing through,
looked up.
</p>

<p>
"It was the old woman," she said.  "I thought
Mr. Mayne might have told you.  She sjambokked me
pretty nearly to death, and threw me down and
dislocated my arm."
</p>

<p>
The clear, soft voice, evenly cadenced, giving out this
astonishing information, raised fresh tumult in the
vicar's bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean your step-mother?" he asked, in horror.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Mr. Mayne had to go to Leitersdorp to get
the will proved.  He was away three days, and she made
up her mind to take it out on me."
</p>

<p>
"To take what out?"
</p>

<p>
"She was mad because father made him my guardian.
She wanted to sell me to a Yankee; he'd given her ten
pounds on account.  So Mr. Mayne told her it was a
case of hands off, because it was his show.  So she got
the children to catch and hold me, and they managed
to tie me up; and she just went on until she was tired,"
said Millie unemotionally.
</p>

<p>
The vicar had no words.  Uppermost in his mind
was deep, abiding thankfulness that he had brought
none of his daughters with him to meet this astounding
young person.  What would his wife say to this?  Such
people, they knew, existed in the pages of those
sensational novels which cannot be too severely
condemned by the well-regulated; but that his own sister's
child should have been strung up and thrashed! ... The
current of hot sympathy in him must have found
vent in indignant words; but it was invaded by another
thought.  The carefully guarded propriety of his own
children must suffer no contact with naked facts of life
like this; and such was the feeling that spoke first.
</p>

<p>
"I must ask you not to mention this.  I should say, I
must order you not to tell your cousins, or Miss Lathom,
their governess, how you came by your injuries.  To
your aunt, in private, it may be alluded to, but I cannot
have so scandalous a thing generally known."
</p>

<p>
Millie looked up swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"I can keep a thing dark, if I am given the tip,"
she said, with amusement that sounded a little
contemptuous.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious of great annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"I give no tips.  I merely say that this must not be
mentioned," he said frigidly.  "We will refer to it later.
And now to touch upon another matter.  In England
the&mdash;ah&mdash;fusion of classes to which you have probably
been accustomed is not desirable.  The vicar's niece
cannot, with propriety, be on terms of equality with a
farmer like Dow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Millie, "why not?"
</p>

<p>
"We are socially Mr. Dow's superiors, and we must
not let him forget his place, as these Dalesmen are most
apt to do."
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought," said Millie reflectively, "that
they would never be likely to forget their place, so long
as we were sure of ours."
</p>

<p>
The vicar again felt uncomfortable.  His wife and he
were well-born&mdash;people of just enough consequence to
be eager that nobody should forget it; undeniably
belonging to the county set, but much ignored by that
set, as being poor and desperately dull.
</p>

<p>
"You see, at home we shouldn't have been socially
superior to Mr. Dow," said Millie.
</p>

<p>
"You have much to learn here," returned her uncle;
and as he spoke, he was inly deciding that the girl was
impossible.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
MELICENT'S COUSINS
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
"Girls' heads are not like jam-pots, which, if you do not fill them
will remain empty; a filling there will be, of some
kind."&mdash;JULIANA HORATIA EWING.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They had been crawling for some time slowly up a
steep lane with hedges; now suddenly they emerged
at the top, and a long sigh of wonder escaped Millie as
she saw the moorland spread before her in all its
untamed splendour.  Great headlands, facing northwards,
jutted forth into the heather, as into a purple
sea; and on the brink of one of these the travellers
found themselves, overlooking a vast stretch of wild
country.  The descent down which they must go was
almost a precipice.  Something in the keen racing air,
the height, the freedom, the glory of it all, took Melicent
by the throat England was like this&mdash;like this!  Sunlight,
colour, the adorable odour of peat and bracken,
drawn out by the sun, the blue mysteries of distance
... it came about her like compelling arms.  Solitude,
silence, spacious calm&mdash;here were elements that appealed
to the depth of her being.  Reserved as she was, she
had nearly cried aloud to her unknown uncle for
sympathy in her sudden rush of feeling for the land of
her forefathers.  He had checked the mare to a walk,
and was coaxing her downhill with caution and skill.
</p>

<p>
"Our roads are not much to boast of hereabouts," he
said at last, as the cart slewed itself over a lump in the
road, designed to prevent heavy rainfall from washing
out the roadway on the violent slope.  "But I daresay
you are not much better off in Africa."
</p>

<p>
"Not much to boast of!  They are glorious!"
breathed Millie, insensible of jolting in her admiration.
"We have nothing like this in Africa!"
</p>

<p>
"A few miles further on, I can show you a road,
compared with which, this might be a billiard-table," he
said cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Millie became aware that he referred to surface and
gradients, and not to landscape.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see," she replied lamely.  "I was thinking
of&mdash;of the heather."
</p>

<p>
"You will see plenty of that," was the composed
answer.  "It begins to grow all over the road, at no
great distance from here."
</p>

<p>
Conversation did not seem easy.  Millie was at no
time talkative, and they fell silent, and so remained
while they traversed several miles of open moor,
crossed a desolate ridge, and presently found themselves
dipping again into a lane with hedges, in all
their autumn glory of ripe blackberries, fluffy travellers'
joy, coral honeysuckle berries and wayfaring tree.
</p>

<p>
"Now we are in Fransdale," said Mr. Cooper.
</p>

<p>
They were labouring along, in narrow, sandy, toilsome
windings, when the hoot of a motor, up somewhere over
their heads, made Mr. Cooper start.  He was leading
the mare, and proceeded to drag her as far as he possibly
could to the side of the lane&mdash;half-way up the hedge, in
fact.  The next moment the car came in sight, tearing
downhill at a speed which was evidently calculated
upon the certainty of clear roads.  It began to bray
loudly, as though, in response to the warning, the vicar
could cause his dog-cart to vanish into thin air.  Millie
surveyed it with interest, and as it whizzed by, within
an inch of their off-wheel, she caught sight of a young,
handsome, bored face, and that of an older man beside
it.  They raised their hats as they swept by, having
most narrowly missed smashing the cart to fragments:
but the vicar seemed quite pleased, and not at all
annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Joseph Burmester and his son&mdash;our big land-owners
hereabouts," he explained.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said his niece; adding, after reflection: "Are
they our social equals?"
</p>

<p>
For some reason, the question annoyed the vicar; he
relapsed into silence.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper prided herself upon keeping all her
Southern customs up here in the North.  When
Melicent came downstairs to tea, she saw none of that
wonderful pastry without which no Cleveshire tea-table
is complete.  Her five girl-cousins and their governess
were assembled to be introduced to their new relative.
They stared at her with a passive and stony indifference.
Madeline was seventeen, Gwendolen sixteen,
Theodora fifteen, Barbara fourteen, and Beatrice twelve.
Even Beatrice was quite as tall as Melicent; and the
elder girls were vast, the two eldest nearing five-foot-ten,
after the fashion of the modern girl, and not in the
least as yet knowing how to manage their swelling
proportions.  In their outgrown, scanty frocks, and big,
thick legs, they looked rather like men in a farce,
dressed up to represent little girls.  Two or three of
them were handsome, but they all struck Millie as
singularly expressionless.  Their faces were like masks.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Chetwynd-Cooper's hair was pale flaxen, and
being brushed away very tightly from the face, gave
the impression of her having no hair at all.  The odd
look of being out of date, achieved in her husband's
case by side-whiskers, was bestowed upon her by long
earrings.  The couple looked like the Papa and Mamma
of a virtuous family, in a very early Victorian story-book.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper sat down to table with a determined
cheerfulness which Melicent soon learned was her
characteristic.  It somehow succeeded in producing
deep depression in others.  At least, nobody spoke;
and the girl found herself with her attention fixed, with
a fatal fascination, upon her aunt's smile and her aunt's
earrings, and longing for something to divert her eye.
</p>

<p>
Her uncle's depression was a very real and
well-defined thing that evening.  There was something
about his new niece which he found himself disliking
with quite unchristian vehemence.  He had confided
to his wife that extreme care would be necessary, and
that the new-comer must by no means be let loose
among their own children.  Mrs. Cooper could not
share his depression.  She had the boundless
self-confidence of an entirely stupid woman.  She had
made her own girls models of all that girls should
be.  No slang was ever heard in the Vicarage; no
loud voices; no unruly expression of opinion.  Why
should she not be equally successful with this raw
material, doubtless sent by Providence to her good
guidance?
</p>

<p>
Melicent sat watching her five munching cousins, and
thought they were something like cows.  Their eyes
were vacant, their appetites steady.  She was just
wondering whether all talking at meals was forbidden,
when Gwendolen, who sat next her, tossed back her
long hair, and asked:
</p>

<p>
"How did you hurt your arm?"
</p>

<p>
Melicent's voice was soft, but singularly clear.  It had
a carrying quality.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Edmund says I am not to tell you," she
replied.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cooper was all the more angry, because he felt
sure that his niece could and would have skated ably
over this thin ice had he not repudiated all wish to
"keep things dark."  She had done exactly what he
told her to do, and he wanted to box her ears.
</p>

<p>
"Give us news of your Cochin China hen, Gwendolen,"
he broke in.  "Has she been laying away again?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in the hedge," said his daughter, giving her
reply in lifeless tone and fewest words; and silence fell
again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, by the way, I have a pleasant surprise for
Melicent," said Mrs. Cooper suddenly, her countenance
wreathed in smiles.  She always spoke as though
coaxing a very young child, who needed encouragement
and reassurance; and her niece resented it as
actively as did the villagers.  "What do you think
arrived for you this morning, Melicent?  Theo, darling,
if you look on mother's desk, you will find a letter for
Cousin Melicent.  I suppose the mail travels faster than
the boat you came in, Melicent."
</p>

<p>
Theo brought a letter and handed it to her cousin,
who took it with composure.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder whom that comes from?" said Mrs. Cooper archly.
</p>

<p>
"It's from Hubert Mestaer."
</p>

<p>
"And who is that?" pursued the lady, delighted
that everybody's attention was so skilfully diverted
from the broken arm.
</p>

<p>
"He is one of the men who wanted to marry me,"
said Millie clearly.
</p>

<p>
In the deadly pause that followed, she caught a
glance, hastily passing under lowered lids, between Miss
Lathom and her two elder pupils.
</p>

<p>
But the valiant Mrs. Cooper was equal even to this
occasion.
</p>

<p>
"When dear Melicent has been with us a little longer,
she will know that we do not talk of such things," she
cooed, blushing as coyly as the heroine in a novel
by Charles Reade.
</p>

<p>
The blush was not to be seen reflected on the stolid
countenances of her daughters.  They chewed on.
</p>

<p>
"What things?" asked Millie, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Our offers of&mdash;marriage," said her aunt, bringing out
the bold word with a gulp.  "You are a little young,
darling, to be thinking of marriage for a great many
years, are you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; that is what I told them," replied Millie simply,
fixing surprised eyes upon the lady's embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
The vicar cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you had better give that letter to your aunt,
Melicent, and let her judge whether it is a fit one
for you to receive."
</p>

<p>
Melicent removed her look of surprise from one end
of the table to another.
</p>

<p>
"I think it would be playing it very low down on
Bert to let anybody see his letter," she said, with
decision.
</p>

<p>
"My girls show me all their letters," said her aunt,
still smiling and coaxing.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon if it sounds rude," replied her
niece, "but I shall not show you mine."
</p>

<p>
The vicar rose from table with decision.
</p>

<p>
"We will discuss this at another time," he said.
"Melicent will, of course, conform to the rules of the
house while she is with us.  For what we have received,
etc.  A word, Miss Lathom, please."  Then, as the
girls filed past, he said low in the governess's ear: "On
no account is she to be left alone with her cousins
for a moment."
</p>

<p>
The girls filed soberly out, led the way upstairs, through
a swing-door, along a passage, into a shabby old room
with deep window-seats, an aged rocking-horse, shelves
of story books and disabled toys, an ink-stained, battered
table, a high fire-guard, and all the usual accessories of
the nursery turned schoolroom.
</p>

<p>
They fastened the swing-door behind them as they
went through, carefully closing the door of the school-room
also; and then all, as it were, exhaling a gasp of
relief, turned to their cousin again with transfigured
faces.
</p>

<p>
"Now we can talk!  Now we can be ourselves!
Now we can have some fun!" they cried, surrounding
her.
</p>

<p>
The masks were dropped, the real girls appeared,
tossing back their hair, stretching their limbs, assuming
every possible attitude of comfort and inelegance.
They all talked at once, crowding round; and the
transition was so abrupt and so complete as to bewilder
her.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," said Gwendolen, who was the handsomest,
and seemed to take the lead, rather than the
petulant and anæmic-looking Madeline.  "Be cautious,
girls! we may very likely be raided this evening; she's
sure to poke her nose in after Melicent.  Put out the
things.  Did you hoist the weight, Babs?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did," said Barbara.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  If you hear the weight fall in the
passage, that's mother," said Madeline, explaining to
Melicent: "You see, it gives us a minute to reform in."
</p>

<p>
They all went to a cupboard, pulled out work,
thimbles, and so on, arranged them on the table, chairs
in place; then threw themselves on the floor, in the
various attitudes which their weak, overgrown spines
demanded, with pillows wedged under them.
</p>

<p>
"Now for peace and happiness," said Gwen.  "Oh,
it was grand to hear you stand up to them, my dear!
But it's no good, you know; you will have to knuckle
under.  They've got nothing else to do but bully us;
and after all, it's not much they can do, you know.
It's as easy as possible to circumvent them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hold your tongue, Gwen! don't chatter so," said
Madeline crossly.  "Give Melicent a chance.  Go on,
Melicent, tell us all about it.  How was your arm
hurt?"
</p>

<p>
Melicent looked surprised.  "I told you I promised
Uncle Edmund not to say," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, gammon! we absolve you from that," laughed
Theo, slipping a warm arm about her cousin's neck.
</p>

<p>
"But I can't absolve myself, you see," said Millie
soberly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you won't tell us?"
</p>

<p>
"I never break my word."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We're five against one, and the youngest is as big
as you," she said, half in fun, half menacing.
</p>

<p>
Millie smiled her own little smile of disdain.
</p>

<p>
"I'm more than a match for the lot of you," she said
coolly.  "I shall say just what I think to you, as I
did to Aunt Minna.  And it's this.  I hate underhand
ways."
</p>

<p>
Miss Lathom, who was seemingly poring over the
correction of some exercises, grew uncomfortably red.
</p>

<p>
"We're not underhand," said Gwen hotly.
"'Tommy'"&mdash;indicating her preceptress with a wave of the
hand&mdash;"knows all about our goings on."
</p>

<p>
"Tommy" looked up nervously.
</p>

<p>
"When you have lived here a little while, Miss
Lutwyche," she said, "you will see that the poor girls
must have some indulgences.  Their mother expects
impossibilities."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why do they stand it?" asked Millie.
</p>

<p>
"We don't stand it," returned Maddie.  "But you had
better all shut up, girls; perhaps Melicent's a tell-tale."
</p>

<p>
"If you had any sense, you'd see that I've just
proved that I'm not," remarked Melicent.
</p>

<p>
"How have you proved it?"
</p>

<p>
"If I keep my word to Uncle Edmund, of course I
shall keep my word to you.  I promise not to tell
tales; and, when I promise, you can go away and
bet on it."
</p>

<p>
The universal squeal of merriment at her funny
phrase restored harmony.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Gwen, "I see that it's best to be
straightforward; but we're not allowed to be.  We
simply have to make our own pleasures, unknown to
them.  We should never read a book, nor get a letter,
nor meet a soul, nor do anything but get up, have
meals, do lessons, go to bed.  Mother won't let us read
a book she hasn't read first; and as she never opens
a book herself from year's end to year's end, there is
an end of that.  We mustn't have a letter unless she
sees it; so of course we have to have our letters sent,
addressed to Tommy, to Bensdale Post Office; and
then there's the adventure of walking over to fetch
them.  You mayn't go out without saying where
you've been, nor spend a halfpenny without telling her
what you bought.  She must really expect us to cheat,
you know; and so we do."
</p>

<p>
"Maddie's going on for eighteen, and Gwen only a
year younger," chimed in Theo, "and they're not
supposed even to know what a young man is, let alone
think about one.  Gwen's awfully gone on Freshfield,
who is Sir Joseph Burmester's agent.  Well, if it was
guessed, I don't know what would happen, for you see
Freshfield is not our social equal&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dears," broke in Miss Lathom, who was on
thorns, "I think all this is very imprudent.  Let your
cousin wait a while, and see how she likes her aunt's
system."
</p>

<p>
"I shall dislike it very much," said Melicent; "but I
shall say so.  Why don't you speak out?"
</p>

<p>
"Because we're dead sick of rows," said Maddie
sulkily.  "There were nothing but rows till Tommy
came.  No governess would stay; they simply couldn't
stand mother.  Then at last Tommy turned up, and
we saw what a decent old sort she was, so we thought
out our plans, and now we do get our fun somehow, and
as long as we hold our tongues at meals, it's all right."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm very sorry for you," said Millie, "but I
think it would be much simpler to say what you mean.
The strongest always wins.  If you stuck together, they
would have to give in."
</p>

<p>
The girls laughed sardonically.  "You don't know
mother," they said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall soon see," said Barbie, who was the
silent one of the five.  "Let Millie try her way, and
see what happens."
</p>

<p>
Millie laughed.  "I certainly shan't try yours," she said.
</p>

<p>
"But you won't side against us with mother?"
suddenly said Gwen.
</p>

<p>
"Rather not.  That isn't my way."
</p>

<p>
"Are you never afraid of anybody?" asked Theo
earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not; what can people do?" contemptuously
asked the girl who had been sjambokked.
</p>

<p>
Theo cuddled up against this new champion as if the
sense of strength were pleasant to her.
</p>

<p>
"Show us your love-letter, won't you, darling?" she
said persuasively.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," replied Millie at once.
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't show you my notes from Freshfield,"
said Gwen.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  It's mean to show men's letters."
</p>

<p>
"We shouldn't do such a thing, except just among
ourselves," replied Maddie indignantly; "and we hoped
you'd be one of us, though goodness knows there's
more than enough of us already."
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Gwen eagerly, "we know you
must be the real kind of natural girl&mdash;not the sort like
mother believes in, Ethel May in the Daisy Chain, you
know&mdash;we know you are not that sort, or you would
not be having lovers to write to you all the way from
Africa.  You do like pretty clothes, and dancing, and
young men&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," said Millie, in her decided way.
"I've had enough of young men to last me a good
while.  I want to see no more young men for years to
come.  I only want one thing really badly"&mdash;she
looked almost pleadingly at Tommy's red, snub-nosed
countenance, as if her sole hope lay there&mdash;"I want to
learn!" cried out the girl who was to corrupt the
Vicarage household.
</p>

<p>
"To learn!"  The words were echoed in six different
tones.
</p>

<p>
"Not <i>lessons</i>?" asked Babs incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Everything," replied Millie, resting her pointed chin
on her small hand.  "I want to know things, and
understand them, and find out how to earn my living;
to do something ... or make something ... I don't
know what, as yet.  I want to get a grip on the world,
and watch for my place there, and take it!"
</p>

<p>
There was complete silence for quite a long time.
At last&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You talk as if you were a boy," said Gwen.  "What
can girls do?"
</p>

<p>
"Everybody can do what they must do," quietly
replied Millie.  "I've got to earn my living, and so
have you, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Earn our living!  Mother would have a fit!" cried
Maddie.
</p>

<p>
"But Uncle Edmund said in his letter that he was
poor," said Millie, puzzled.  "What should you do if
he died?"
</p>

<p>
"Get married, if we could," laughed Theo.  "Willie
and Georgie say we're such frights, we never shall.  But
we think Gwen is good-looking, and you see she's got
a lover already; and she says when she's married
she'll see after all of us&mdash;take us out of this hateful old
Dale, and go to live at Brighton or London or some
place where we could make friends.  Nobody will make
friends here, because mother's such an old
stick-in-the-mud&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The filial sentiment died away, for there was the
sound of a soft thud.
</p>

<p>
"The weight, girls!  Mother!" whispered Bee; and
in a moment, with a dexterity born of long practice,
the whole flock of lounging girls had arisen, slipped
into place, and were busily stitching when Mrs. Cooper,
with her smile, her long neck, and her earrings, peeped
archly round the door.
</p>

<p>
"Making friends?" said she, beaming.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mrs. Cooper," said Tommy, looking up.
</p>

<p>
The governess was feeling decidedly uncomfortable.
She had repeatedly warned her pupils, during the
preceding days, to hold aloof at first from the
new-comer, until they had decided whether she could be
taken into confidence.  But Millie's love-letter, and
still more, her calm refusal to show it, had sent the
barriers down with a rush, and the girls had not been
able to think of prudence with such a keen new interest
in their blank lives.  Tommy's heart was full of
apprehension.  She was afraid of this girl who wanted
to learn.  She knew that she had nothing to teach her.
</p>

<p>
Melicent had not moved a muscle when the general
rush was made.  She sat still in the window-seat,
upright and solitary.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Melicent must join our happy little sewing
circle," said Mrs. Cooper, beaming round.  "No idle
hands at the Vicarage, as you see, darling."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot use my arm very well yet," said Melicent.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we give you one evening's grace," responded the
lady playfully.  "Have you been taught to work?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how sad!  Why, Miss Lathom, we have a task
before us!  Can you not use a needle at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  I can make and mend my clothes, and so
on.  But I had to teach myself."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.  "You don't mean that you
made the suit you have on?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Mrs. Cooper.  The wind was taken out
of her sails.  "Why, you are quite a <i>genius</i>!  We
shall have to take <i>lessons</i>.  But now, I came to ask
you to come with me, and I will show you your
room, and we will have a little talk."
</p>

<p>
Millie rose obediently, and followed her aunt from
the room; as they went, the masks dropped, the
girls lifted their heads and looked at each other with
intense interest.
</p>

<p>
"She's going to make her show the letter."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE JARRING ELEMENT
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
"She was one of that numerous class of females, whose society
can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in
the world who could like them well enough to marry
them."&mdash;JANE AUSTEN.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The first idea suggested by Mrs. Cooper to the mind
of the beholder was almost inevitably the above.  How
could any man ever have liked her well enough to marry
her?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chetwynd-Cooper was among those unfortunates
who are sent into the world without a sense of humour.
He thus fell a victim to the same error of judgment
which poor well-meaning King George the Third had
committed before him: that of mistaking a dull,
pretentious prig for a really good woman.  Perhaps
no queen in history, of whatever moral character,
ever made a greater fiasco as the bringer-up of a
large family than did Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
But in this respect Mrs. Cooper vied with
her, and for the same reason.  Each was so secure
in her own belief in herself as possessed of all the
domestic virtues, that to her the possibility of making
a mistake never presented itself.
</p>

<p>
Such women are beyond the reach of argument.
Mrs. Cooper had decided, quite early in life&mdash;on what
grounds is not known&mdash;that to be such a woman
as she was, ought to be the goal of all female
endeavour.  Hence, nothing could shake the
complacency of her own content.  She never tired of the
pose of the perfect wife and mother, the parochial
guardian angel; and this, although her nursery had
been the epitome of untidiness and mismanagement,
and her husband was obliged to keep her accounts,
and in other ways to step into the breach continually
to supply her glaring deficiencies.  Neither was she
discomposed by the fact that all her own children
had found her out at an early age.  If her husband ever
broke through his habitual reserve, and remonstrated
with her, she met him with the patient smile of the
saint who is misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
Very soon after marriage he had found out the iron
hand beneath her velvet glove.  He had discovered that
his own influence was nil, that argument could not
move her, that opposition merely stiffened her smiling
obstinacy.  He had sunk into that life which is the
most terrible form of solitude: complete isolation from
those nearest to him.  The worst of it was that, though
he had no effect upon his wife, she had a gradual and
insidious effect upon him.  Continual contact with a
dwarfed intelligence was causing inevitable deterioration,
of which he was not aware.
</p>

<p>
Had the dalesmen known his daily martyrdom, he
might have gained them; but his pride and his loyalty
pushed him back behind barred doors.  And what
nobody yet had ever divined, this new niece of his knew
before she had been twenty-four hours under his roof.
</p>

<p>
It made him hate her.  The first time her grave,
tranquil eyes rested upon her aunt, he felt that she
understood and despised her.  Then that same limpid
gaze&mdash;direct, keen, pure&mdash;travelled to him, the man
who was the life-companion of such a woman.  He
could feel her thought probing him, wondering at him,
pitying him.  He had not at first thought her like his
sister, the dead Melicent to whom he had been sincerely
attached.  But when he encountered that wonderful
glance, he saw the likeness so strongly that he
afterwards never forgot it&mdash;was never able to look at
the younger Melicent without thinking of her more
beautiful, radiant mother, who had followed the man
she loved into the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
But the very likeness embittered him.  He had
always nursed a grudge against his wilful sister&mdash;a
half-contemptuous grudge, as against one who had
stepped outside the pale of conventions held so sacred
by his own wife.  Was her young daughter to come
from the wilds to sit in judgment upon this exemplary
pair, who found the straitest paths of domestic
dulness wide enough for them to walk in?  He
almost wished that Melicent would do something
that should justify him in his dislike of her.
</p>

<p>
He was brooding over it alone in his study, where
he wrote with much care his cold, dry, unreal sermons,
when his wife's head appeared round the door, with her
usual coy smile.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Quite</i> unsuccessful, my darling boy," she said.
"She defies me openly; and yet I flatter myself
I was <i>most</i> diplomatic."
</p>

<p>
Like many essentially cold-hearted people,
Mrs. Cooper was prodigal of endearing epithets.  Her
husband, on principle, never used any.
</p>

<p>
"A direct command would, I imagine, have met the
case better than diplomacy," he said, in his cold,
collected tones.  "What did she say?  Was she
rude?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly.  She said it would be a breach
of confidence to show her letter, but that she would
see that the young man wrote no more.  She also said
that she insists upon her right to correspond with
her guardian without the letters being overlooked.
Rather a <i>shocking</i> way to talk to me, wasn't it?
But we must be very forgiving at first, I see that,
and make very big <i>allowances</i> for the poor darling!
The guardian himself seems to be quite young, and
unmarried.  Why did not poor Arnold appoint you
guardian?  As it is, she evidently thinks we have no
authority."
</p>

<p>
He sat, with a mind oddly divided between dislike
for the girl who defied him, and a sneaking satisfaction
that Minna had been routed for once&mdash;by his sister's
child!
</p>

<p>
"However," said his wife, secure as ever in her own
infallibility, "we shall manage her all right in the end.
The example of our girls will be <i>invaluable</i>.  It is best
to put the matter aside for the present, and let her settle
down."
</p>

<p>
"Will she settle down, do you think?" asked the vicar.
</p>

<p>
There was a tolerant, complacent smile.  "My
darling boy, I have trained five, and why not a
sixth?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar did not contradict her; he merely asked:
</p>

<p>
"Did she tell you what her letter contained?"
</p>

<p>
"She said she had not opened it yet, which I fear
must have been a&mdash;a&mdash;<i>tarradidle</i>"&mdash;Mrs. Cooper went,
through certain evolutions of lips and eyes, intended as
a mute apology for her use of a word so shocking&mdash;"but
she said she felt sure it was only to say that, if
she is not happy here, the writer had a home waiting
for her."
</p>

<p>
"Preposterous nonsense!  She is a child, and the
man probably a savage," said the vicar, with some
bitterness.  "Picture Maddie or Gwen receiving a note
of the kind!"
</p>

<p>
But when Millie did open Bert's letter, the contents
were of a wholly different nature from what she had
expected.
</p>

<p>
It merely contained a brief announcement of the fact
that he had enlisted in that regiment of scouts which
later was known to fame as Lacy's Lions.
</p>

<p>
In the schoolroom, the knowledge that Melicent had
stood firm communicated an electrical excitement to
the atmosphere.  The idea of possible revolt opened
prospects of which nobody had as yet dared to think.
Unconsciously to themselves, her cousins already
regarded her as a strike-leader&mdash;a Moses who should
lead them out of the house of bondage.
</p>

<p>
And yet no creature could have been less anxious for
revolt than this girl.  Her one desire was to fall upon
knowledge and devour it.  She was ready to become
the slave of anyone who would teach her.
</p>

<p>
But one day in the schoolroom was enough to quench
hope from that quarter.  The education bestowed on
her by her father had been partial; but what she
knew, she knew thoroughly.  Her Latin and arithmetic
and Euclid were all good; her knowledge of geography
and English history made Tommy feel quite faint.  Of
French and German she was wholly ignorant, and could
not pick out the notes on the piano.
</p>

<p>
But in all respects she knew enough to know that
Tommy knew nothing.  All the morning the governess
was experiencing the annoyance which Mr. Cooper had
known, feeling the clear eyes upon her full of judgment.
</p>

<p>
The leading point in the education of Mr. Cooper's
girls was that they should have no judgment.  They
were always to be content to accept what they were
told.  When they came in contact with actual life, their
only standard would be that such and such a thing was
according to, or differed from, what they were used to.
</p>

<p>
"I am a great believer in the power of habit," the
vicar was wont to say.  Poor soul!  Habit had
moulded him with a vengeance; he might be excused
for thinking highly of its powers over the human
intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Melicent was a problem to her cousins.  They were
fascinated by her, as the weak must always be by the
strong; but they resented her aloofness.  And they
were simply bewildered by her tastes.
</p>

<p>
Tommy was&mdash;<i>sub rosâ</i>, of course&mdash;reading aloud to
them a thrilling serial from the <i>Daily Looking-glass</i>.
It was called "Phyllis and the Duke," and was a story
of the pure love of that gallant nobleman, the Duke of
Mendip, for his sister's governess, the lovely Phyllis de
Forester; of the machinations of his envious cousin,
Captain the Honourable Percy Blagdon; and of how
Phyllis turned out to be the unacknowledged daughter
of an Earl, and the true owner of the Honourable
Percy's estates.  They had reached a thrilling chapter,
in which the trembling young governess went to
interview a clairvoyante, in a mystic kind of house in
St. John's Wood, to ascertain what had become of her
chivalrous lover.  Tommy was uneasy when the story
took this turn.  She did not like the sound of a
mysterious house in St. John's Wood, and began to
reflect, with resentment, that nowadays you could not
trust even the <i>feuilleton</i> of a halfpenny journal to be
wholly inoffensive.  But the writer was perfectly equal
to the occasion, and knew his public to a nicety&mdash;or
might we say, to a nastiness?  The clairvoyante turned
out to be Phyllis's deeply injured mamma, a young
lady who would on no account have gone without the
indispensable marriage ceremony; and the gentleman
who exploited her, and "ran" the mysterious house,
was her own brother, Phyllis's uncle, who long had
sought his beloved niece in vain.
</p>

<p>
"I can't think why you don't like it," sighed Gwen,
whose eyes were kindled, her cheeks aglow.
</p>

<p>
"It is so unreal and so silly," said her cousin calmly.
"People don't go on like that.  I like a story that
makes you forget that it's not true."
</p>

<p>
"Such as what?" they asked her.
</p>

<p>
After reflection&mdash;"Such as 'Silas Marner,'" she said.
</p>

<p>
They had never heard of "Silas Marner."
</p>

<p>
The glorious autumn weather continued, and two or
three days after Millie's arrival they took her for a
long walk, out of the Dale, along Radlem Rigg, to look
at the curious old prehistoric relic locally known as
Tod's Trush.
</p>

<p>
The loveliness of her surroundings was again borne
in upon Millie.  The same up-soaring of spirit which
she had experienced when her uncle drove her from
the station once more exhilarated her.  She could not
analyse what it was that she found so different here
from the land of her birth.  She came from a country
of clear air and vast spaces, of solitude and immeasurable
distance.  These dales were small in comparison
with the endless rippling veldt she knew.  But here
there confronted her an element which she was quick to
feel, though as yet too young to define&mdash;the element of
mystery.
</p>

<p>
Strange it is that a few atmospheric effects should
have power to lift the soul into new realms, into the
brooding heart of a tender, tinted secret, which haunts
the uplands and the valleys of Cleveshire, making a
promised land of every peak that emerges, suggestive,
from its golden, shimmering veil.  The primal truth
which underlay the power of the Veiled Isis was here;
but in the North the magic is stronger, because to its
mystery it adds the crowning note of austerity.
</p>

<p>
There is a loneliness which is the result, not of
distance, but of inaccessibility.  The dwellers in two
valleys, perhaps five miles apart, divided by a high
mountain, a dangerous pass, are separated far more
thoroughly than those who dwell with fifty miles of
plain between them, which the train will traverse in an
hour.  These dales give the impression of something
remote, inviolable&mdash;something stern and shy, yet with a
heart of glowing colour, of infinite tenderness, for those
who can understand.
</p>

<p>
The Trush itself, when they reached it, was an old
barrow, or tumulus, the earth covering of which had
been entirely removed centuries ago.  It was a square
kist of stones, the top of which had fallen in.  The
coffin, or coffins, which it must once have contained,
had vanished so long ago that a persistent local
tradition maintained that there had never been any; but
that the little house had been the abode of a being of
supernatural origin, called Tod, concerning whom
antiquarians cudgelled their brains in vain.  Two
upright slabs still stood like the jambs of a tiny
doorway, with a lintel across; the whole surrounded by
a circular wreath of large stones, which probably defined
the original size of the mound.
</p>

<p>
To Melicent, who had never seen anything of the
kind before, the vacant and lonely sepulchre was fraught
with great pathos.  Her thoughts took wing, and
wandered to the times when human hands had erected
this monument, and wondered whether it then stood in
such unbroken solitude as it did now.
</p>

<p>
They had brought cakes with them, and a bottle of
milk, and they all sat down among the heather and
harebells, and refreshed themselves, while Tommy read
a fresh instalment of "Phyllis and the Duke."

CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
LANCE BURMESTER IS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,<br>
  Our fatal shadows that walk by us still."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;FLETCHER.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Nothing compelled Melicent to listen, so she sat on
Tod's Trush, just over his pathetic little doorway, her
arms round her knees, her eyes fixed, full of the
forward-reaching, time-devouring dreams of youth, upon
the lovely lines of the land, ridge beyond ridge, dying
into grape-bloom haze upon the faint horizon.
</p>

<p>
She was not unhappy.  Her isolation hardly
distressed her; she was accustomed to being an alien
among unsympathetic people.  She was, however,
considering what she should do.  She actively disliked
her aunt, was repelled by her uncle, mentally herded
her cousins and their governess together as so many
silly triflers, not particularly honest.  But all this she
could bear, if only she might learn to fit herself for her
future; and this, it appeared, was impossible.
</p>

<p>
If only it had not been so!  For here she felt that
she could live and work.  Soul and body were being
laved in pure air&mdash;renewed and vivified.  The terrible
sense of antagonism to all her surroundings which she
had always felt in Africa was gone.  There she had
been craving, craving all the time for she knew not
what; her cry had been that of Paracelsus&mdash;"I go to
find my soul!"  It seemed to her that she had found
it, or would find it, in the stern keeping of this rugged
land, where the only thing that was out of harmony
was the attitude of her own kindred.
</p>

<p>
Just opposite to her, among the broken ground which
rose from the main valley, forming a ridge parallel to
that on which she sat, was a little house, embowered in
fruit trees.
</p>

<p>
An ampylopsis creeper on the grey stone wall
gave a touch of vivid scarlet; a great purple Jackmanii
clematis smothered the porch.
</p>

<p>
"There," thought Melicent, "I could wish to be.
There I could live and learn things, and the days would
never seem too long."
</p>

<p>
She studied the little remote place, trying to see
whether any road led to it, and admiring the way in
which it stood, as if lifting its face to the kisses of the
southern and western sun.
</p>

<p>
Lost in reverie, she had not heard the approach of
anyone, and was surprised when a dog jumped through
the heather near her, on the side of the Trush farthest
from where her cousins were seated.  A whirring of
strong brown wings arose from their covert, and a
grouse family shot up, with indignant "<i>Cock-cocks</i>,"
wheeling in the blue air.  Three guns cracked, and in
a moment the five Vicarage girls were on their feet.
</p>

<p>
As three sportsmen appeared, Gwen made one bound
to where Millie sat, her face aflame.
</p>

<p>
"It's Freshfield," she gasped in her ear, "and young
Mr. Burmester, and somebody I don't know.  Oh, I
wish he was alone!  He won't dare to speak to us.
Look at his nice curly dark hair!  Isn't he
scrumptious?"
</p>

<p>
The young agent, with an expression of acute discomfort,
had raised his hat to the phalanx of great girls.
Mr. Burmester was looking bewildered at the sudden
appearance of what looked like a boarding-school out
for a walk emerging from the heather.  He also pulled
off his cap, and said, in the deprecating tones of a very
young man:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say!  I'm afraid we startled you."  With
which he made as though to pass on.
</p>

<p>
Millie had not moved from her seat on the Trush; it
was not her way to be startled.  She had taken off her
hat, and sat there bare-headed in the sunset, her heart
full of quiet, like Wordsworth's nun&mdash;too steeped in
Nature's calm to notice this intrusion.
</p>

<p>
The third member of the shooting party had paused
to examine the lock of his gun.  He was a short, rather
thick-set man, with very blue, clear eyes, which
redeemed his face from the common-place&mdash;which saw
beauty in all Nature, and seemed to exact truth from
men.  When he raised these eyes from the gun, he saw
Millie seated there on the Trush, and he gave a glad
laugh, not at all surprised, but full of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Melicent!  There you are!" he cried out
heartily.
</p>

<p>
Melicent bounded up, looked around, pushed away
Gwen, who stood before her, and leaping into the
heather, flew to her friend.  She gave a little cry of
gladness.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Helston!  How did you get here?  Is Mrs. Helston
here too?"
</p>

<p>
"She's not actually here in sight, but she's not far
off," he replied, putting his arm round her.  "You'll see
her very soon.  You must present me to your cousins.
Lance, I've found a friend."
</p>

<p>
Lancelot Burmester, in secret terror of what he called
"flappers," came up awkwardly.  He was a clever-looking
fellow, fair, with an incisive profile, a pale face
and pince-nez.  He advanced from one side, as Tommy,
anxious and heated, hurried up on the other.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lutwyche and I are old friends," said
Mr. Helston pleasantly.  "We made the voyage from
Africa together.  Have I the pleasure of speaking to
Mrs. Cooper?"
</p>

<p>
Tommy, blushing, disclaimed the honour, explained
her identity, and shook hands with young Burmester.
Freshfield, meanwhile, slipped round to Gwen behind
the backs of the party.
</p>

<p>
"I know something of Mayne, Miss Lutwyche's
guardian," said Mr. Helston in explanation; "and at
his request my wife and I undertook the serious task
of keeping this young person in order for the voyage."  He
did not add that he had himself paid the difference
between first and second-class fare for her.  "After her
being so cruelly mishandled," he said, "you may imagine
she needed care.  She was not really fit to travel, but
she was so eager to be off."  He smiled down at her.
"I think she looks a little different," he concluded quite
fondly, "from what she did when we first took her in
hand."
</p>

<p>
"But you have not said yet how you got here?"
urged Millie, who was holding, in both hers, the hand
that hung over her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Why, the very day you left us I ran up against
Burmester in Pall Mall, and he said, 'Come down for
a week's shooting,' and when we realised that Ilberston
is, as it were, next door to Fransdale, you may imagine
that we were doubly minded to come.  Well, here we
are!  And how do you like England?"
</p>

<p>
"If by England you mean Fransdale," said Millie, "I
like it in a way that can't be put in words."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, it can be put in words; the thing's been
done.  You should read the works of one William
Wordsworth," struck in Lance Burmester.
</p>

<p>
Millie raised her eyes to his face> and apparently
liked what she found there.
</p>

<p>
"Should I?  I will," she said thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"What have you done to your arm?" asked the
young man kindly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap," said Harry Helston, "what this
scrap of a child has been through would have broken
the spirit of anybody else.  Her brute of a Boer
stepmother&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Millie turned to him quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Please, Mr. Helston, my uncle does not wish it
known," she said, with sedate dignity.
</p>

<p>
"What?  Oh, very well, pussie!" replied her friend,
gazing round at the eager faces of the governess and
the girls; "I'll say no more, then.  Mustn't get you
into trouble.  What are you up to with my gun?
Want to shoot a bird&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do let me," she begged; "I've not had a chance
for so long!  My arm is well enough for me to be able
to take a sight.  Do let me try!"
</p>

<p>
"Come this way.  Freshfield says there are any
amount of birds just over this ridge," said Burmester
eagerly.  "I should like to see you shoot."
</p>

<p>
Melicent possessed herself of the gun, and went
forward, laughing and sparkling.  The others followed
as if spellbound.  Nobody had an eye for Freshfield
and Gwen, who came slowly behind, making the most
of their moment.  Very soon, up went the whir of
brown wings again.  Millie stopped, took aim with what
seemed to be great deliberation; there was a breathless
pause; a bird fell; everyone was laughing and
congratulating the sportswoman.  Lance Burmester
presented her with her prize, and added another to
make a brace.  She was urged to come on, and repeat
her exploit, but Tommy was growing nervous, and
interfered.
</p>

<p>
"The vicar might not like it&mdash;they must be getting home."
</p>

<p>
Melicent went, quite happily, having received the
assurance that her friends were at hand, and would look
her up before long.  She was unprepared for the torrent
of reproaches and abuse which streamed forth upon her
head as soon as they were out of sight of the shooting
party.
</p>

<p>
"You mean little cat!"  "You're a regular sneak!"  "We
know now, it's you yourself that want to keep it
dark!"  "Why couldn't you hold your tongue!"  "Father
said <i>you</i> were not to mention it, he never said
a word about other people."
</p>

<p>
Their meaning began to dawn upon her at last.
</p>

<p>
"You mean my not allowing Mr. Helston to tell how
I broke my arm?  Well, of all the people I ever met,
you have the most low-down notions of honour!" she
cried indignantly.  "You are just like my half-brothers
and sisters!  I always thought English people were
straight, that it was only Boers that were such
skunks!"
</p>

<p>
Tommy interfered, and reproved Millie for using bad
language; and a more congenial topic was soon found,
in the delights of having met and spoken to, not only
Freshfield, but Mr. Burmester himself.
</p>

<p>
"Maddie wants him for her young man," explained
Theo; "only we didn't see how the thing was to be
begun, because, you see, we never get any chance to
speak to him.  Father and mother did go to dine with
Sir Joseph once, but mother doesn't like Lady Burmester.
She is dreadfully High Church, she thinks everybody
ought to go to the Communion service every Sunday,
and we only have it once a month, so on the other
Sundays Lady Burmester drives all the way to Ilberston.
Mother thinks it so impertinent of Lady Burmester to
think she can possibly know better than a clergyman's
wife.  She said she wouldn't go there again; but I don't
think they've been asked.  You know really, mother
doesn't know anything at all about it.  I asked her why
it was wrong to have that service every week, because
we are supposed to believe in the Catholic Church, and
all other Catholics seem to; so she said it was most
improper for a young girl to argue about such things,
as her father was sure to know best I said: 'If he
knows, won't he explain to me?' and she said: 'You
must wait till you are a great deal older.'"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow is the first Sunday in the month," chimed
in Maddie, "so they will all be there.  What did you
think of Lancelot Burmester's looks?  Do tell us all
about the Helstons.  You were lucky to make friends
with them, I daresay they will ask you to stay.  Mother
doesn't like us to go and stay away, for fear of our
hearing naughty words.  She doesn't think anybody is
so well brought up as we are!  If she could only hear
some of the stories Willie and Georgie bring home from
school!"
</p>

<p>
They all laughed at this.
</p>

<p>
"The real reason is, we have no clothes to go in, and
she can't afford to buy us any," grumbled Theo, who
was perhaps the handsomest of the girls, and the
cleverest too.
</p>

<p>
"I daresay you could make your own if you tried,"
said Melicent.  "I'd help.  I think you ought to make
your own clothes."
</p>

<p>
In the interest suddenly created by this new idea,
nobody noticed that during the whole of the walk home
Gwen, the talkative, never said a word.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"George, what an epidemic of girls!" groaned Lance,
as soon as Tommy and her brood were out of sight.
"Those poor Coopers!  As if their own great, ugly
five were not enough, but they must take on another to
make the half-dozen!"
</p>

<p>
"It is an act of true kindness," replied Helston.
"For a man with five daughters of his own to
make room for another, shows him to be extremely
conscientious."
</p>

<p>
"The little cousin," critically said Lance, "has
something fetching about her.  Nothing to look at,
but one is conscious of a personality."
</p>

<p>
"I never look at her," said Millie's friend, "but those
lines occur to my mind&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The good stars met in your horoscope<br>
  Made you of spirit, fire and dew."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I don't know about the dew; she's a skinny little
wisp," was the uncivil comment.
</p>

<p>
"Wait till she grows up," said Millie's champion.
"You would wonder there was anything left of her if
you knew what she has come through.  But I gave
her my word, so I mustn't tell you; and after all," he
added, musing, "I don't wonder that the vicar doesn't
want the tale to get about; it's not a pretty story, and
I daresay would do the child no good in a narrow-minded,
provincial circle."
</p>

<p>
"I can't think how she will get on with those
Coopers," remarked Burmester.  "Did you ever see
such raw material?  And you heard what my mater
said at lunch?  They are such hide-bound, pragmatical&mdash;no
doing anything with them.  The vicar quietly
goes his way, listening to nobody's wishes&mdash;thinks
himself infallible.  The pater has given him up as a
bad job; says you might as well have a cabbage at the
Vicarage!  Hall, of Ilberston, is such a good chap!
He might give this Southerner many a hint.  But the
Coopers won't have a word to say to him, because he
has a weekly Eucharist, and makes the schoolchildren
attend."
</p>

<p>
Helston listened with sinkings of the heart.  This
did not sound like a household in which Melicent
would be happy.  But report is often one-sided.  He
determined to judge for himself.

<br><br>
THE BREAKING-IN OF MELICENT

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The following day Sir Joseph and Lady Burmester,
with their guests, duly attended the ugly little church
in Fransdale.
</p>

<p>
There had been a church there since the dawnings of
English history.  But, as the Reformed Church lost her
grip upon the strong, narrow minds of the Dalesmen,
it had been allowed to fall in ruins.  Then had come
the disastrous "churchwarden" restoration, which had
abolished all landmarks.  A stumpy little box-like
structure now stood among the ancient graves, in a
velvet-smooth meadow overshadowed by the frowning
hills which closed round the head of the Dale.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper had been duly informed by Tommy
of the meeting with the gentlemen from the Grange,
and of the fact that one of them seemed to be a great
friend of Melicent's.  There was no valid reason why
this news should displease her; but it did.  She was
vexed that her insignificant niece should have so many
friends.  The passion of jealousy was smouldering
deep down in her heart, among other dormant forces
of which she was unaware.  Like many parents, while
constantly assuring herself and her children that looks
were nothing, she nevertheless expected the girls to be
admired and sought out.  When first she saw Millie,
she had experienced relief at the thought that such a
thin, pale shrimp of a girl could never prove a rival to
her own.  That she should be thrust forth to the notice
of the Burmesters, so early in her sojourn at Fransdale,
was most displeasing; she told herself that it must
give the poor child a totally false idea of her own
importance.
</p>

<p>
However, forewarned is forearmed.  She was ready
after service with the sweetest smiles of the amiable
aunt, to be presented to the Helstons, and thank them
suitably for their care of "poor darling Melicent."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Helston was a picturesque woman, a brunette,
with hair prematurely grey, which set off the tints of
her bright complexion.  She wore a wide hat with
strings, and her smile captivated the hearts of the five
staring Miss Coopers.
</p>

<p>
Lady Burmester was not a tactful person.  She did
not like the Coopers, whom she thought pompous and
prosy.  She proceeded to ask Mrs. Cooper to come to
lunch the following day, and to bring her niece with
her.  She did not include any of the vicar's daughters
in her invitation.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper smiled, and gushed, and seemed so
delighted with the invitation, that her ladyship was
conscious of a slight shock when she found that she was
refusing it.  It was early days yet, and would be
unsettling for dear Melicent, who must get a little more
used to English ways before she could bring her out.
She knew dear Lady Burmester would understand.
She suggested instead, that the two ladies from the
Grange should come to tea at the Vicarage one afternoon;
suppose they were to say Wednesday?
</p>

<p>
In a bewildered way Lady Burmester submitted to
this unlooked-for dictation, and, taken by surprise,
obediently said Wednesday; but as they were driving
home, she suddenly turned to her friend and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Why wouldn't that perverse woman lunch with me,
I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
Brenda Helston laughed her good, sincere laugh.
</p>

<p>
"My dear!  You invited her niece, not her daughter!"
</p>

<p>
"O-o-oh!  So that was where the shoe pinched,"
said her ladyship, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"You should always make allowances for human
nature," commented Brenda.  "It would not be human
for a woman with all those daughters not to be touchy
at seeing them passed over.  We must propitiate her
on Wednesday.  I want to get Melicent to myself&mdash;to
find out what she is thinking and feeling.  I shall not
be able to say half that I wish to, at the Vicarage."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay that supplies a second reason for her
aunt's refusal!" said her friend, amused.  "You and
Mr. Helston have a very high opinion of that funny little
white-faced girl, have you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Very!" said Brenda emphatically.  "I never saw
any creature so famished for the little tendernesses of
life, so responsive to kindness, so eager to improve herself.
Had you seen her when she first came on board&mdash;sullen,
<i>farouche</i>, always on the defensive ... and how she
melted and sweetened, and blossomed forth!  Harry
and I positively love her.  We always, as you know,
longed for a daughter.  We have written to Carol
Mayne, telling him that we will give her a home if she
is not happy with her own people.  He was doubtful;
he thought the uncle's letter cold-blooded.  But really,
as I asked him, how could you expect enthusiasm on
the part of a man with all those daughters, at the
prospect of having another thrust upon him?  I told
Carol at the time, I liked the writer for being guarded;
he could not know what she was."
</p>

<p>
"Does he strike you," asked Lady Burmester, "as
being the kind of man to find out?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Helston hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I fear not; he struck me as a dense kind of man.
I heard Harry ask him, after service, whether this church
were on the site of the old one&mdash;whether any of the
old material had been built in; and he replied that he
did not know, and had never inquired.  I am afraid
that will settle him, in Harry's estimation!"  They both
laughed gaily.  "Harry looked," said his wife, "much as
he might have done, had the vicar said that he did not
know who his mother was, and had never inquired."
</p>

<p>
"There is a difference between him and Mr. Hall,"
observed Lady Burmester.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; was he not interesting yesterday?  I shall not
soon forget that wonderful church on the verge of the
precipice.  One feels that one knows the true meaning
of sermons in stones when you have heard him talk of
Ilberston.  He knows every stone in his church, and
every heart in his parish."
</p>

<p>
It was on Monday that Alfred Dow, riding down the
Dale, came, as he passed the inn, upon Millie as she
stood in the road with her cousins, waiting for Tommy,
who had gone into the Post Office.
</p>

<p>
He promptly dismounted, and Melicent, her face
brightening, proceeded to shake hands cordially, the
girls looking on, divided between horror and interest.
This was in the sight of the sun; for the inn, and the
cluster of cottages known as Church Houses, composed
the only nucleus the village could be said to possess;
and everyone was looking on.
</p>

<p>
Upon this scene the vicar came, emerging from a
vexatious interview with a stiff-necked churchwarden;
and he was not pleased.
</p>

<p>
His manner, as he greeted his nonconforming
parishioner, was congealed.  His voice, with its
inward stillness, frightened his daughters.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Cooper, I want you to let all your young
ladies come up to tea with my mother at Crow Gate."  He
called it, in local speech, Crow Yat.  "Let 'em
come an' see t' ponies an' t' foal an' t' calves, an' taste
mother's damson gin, for we've a drop left yet.  Let this
lady bring 'em, if she'll be so kind.  Let's see"&mdash;he
raised his cap and scratched his curly poll.  "To-day's
Monday.  Suppose we said Thursday.  An' we'll hear
more o' they Boers," he added mischieviously, to
Millie.
</p>

<p>
"If Mrs. Dow is kind enough to second your invitation,
perhaps she would write direct to Mrs. Cooper,"
said the vicar, still more gelid.  "I cannot say what
her plans are for this week."
</p>

<p>
Dow turned slightly away, looked down at Millie,
and deliberately shut one eye.  Yet she could see that
he was angry too.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;well; mother's not a grand letter-writer," he
said cheerfully, "but I'll tell her your wishes.  Good
day, passon!"
</p>

<p>
"Good day, Mr. Dow!"
</p>

<p>
The vicar walked back with Miss Lathom and the
six girls.
</p>

<p>
"You will, please," said he to the governess, "when
you have occasion to enter a shop, take Melicent with
you.  I thought I had told you that she is never
to be left with her cousins.  She is wholly untrustworthy.
After ten years in this parish I have more or
less succeeded in showing these people that their free
and easy ways are not for me; and now I am to come
and find my niece and daughters unchaperoned in the
public street, laughing and joking with a dissenting
farmer!  I will not have it!"
</p>

<p>
Tommy was abject.  She trembled before him; but
when he sent for Millie into the study, it was a different
thing.  He asked her what excuse she had for her
behaviour.  She asked in wonder:
</p>

<p>
"What behaviour?"
</p>

<p>
He explained the enormity of her conduct, adding
that he was under the impression that he had told her,
on the day of her arrival, that in England, social
distinctions must be observed.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you may not even speak to
anyone who is not your social equal?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I mean it!  When Mr. Dow greeted you
to-day, you should have merely bowed, and turned to
speak to one of your cousins; then he would have been
obliged to pass on."
</p>

<p>
"In Africa," said his niece, "we should think that
contemptible."
</p>

<p>
"As you know, that is just the point.  We are not in
Africa, but in England, where a social code exists."
</p>

<p>
"And as long as I am with you, must I behave
so&mdash;pretending not to see people who have been kind
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"As long as you live with me, you will do as I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Whether I think it right or not?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; you have no right to set your judgment
against mine."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for explaining that to me.  I am afraid
I shall not be able to stay with you," she said simply.
</p>

<p>
"That is a foolish, as well as a rude speech, Melicent."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon; I am sorry I am foolish, and I
did not mean to be rude.  Is that all you wanted to say
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsensical impertinence!" said the vicar.  "Where
could you go, I wonder, if I declined to keep you?"
</p>

<p>
"To Mr. and Mrs. Helston," she replied unhesitatingly.
"They have told Mr. Mayne that they would like to
have me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, upon my word!"  The vicar was well-nigh
jolted out of his composure.  He pulled himself together
only by a strong effort.  "Leave the room," he said.
"Apologise, and leave the room."
</p>

<p>
"What am I to apologise for?"
</p>

<p>
"For gross impertinence."
</p>

<p>
After a minute's pause.
</p>

<p>
"I have not been impertinent," she said, "and I shall
not apologise.  I think you in the wrong."
</p>

<p>
She walked out of the room, leaving an angry man
behind her.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The vicar's quiet insolence had aroused Alfred Dow,
as it roused all his parishioners, to a feeling of active
hostility.  He felt a desire to get the better of him, if
he could.
</p>

<p>
He sent a man next day with a note from Mrs. Dow
to Mrs. Cooper&mdash;a note which the old lady had written
with many protests, telling her son he was "nobbut a
giddy fool" to be asking such a thing of her.  Why
should she make her best cheese-cakes for "them
loompin' lasses o' passon's?"&mdash;when madam treated all
dissenters as the dirt beneath her feet?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper was very undecided as to what answer
she should return, when the unwelcome note arrived.
On the one hand, she detested the Dows, and did not
like to be indebted to them.  They had never invited
her girls before; she felt that this invitation was really
on Melicent's account.  Furthermore, Melicent was in
disgrace, and did not deserve a treat.  On the other
hand, she knew that her five, who were never asked
out, longed to go.  It would be a sign to the whole
village of a splendid condescension, did she allow it.
Also, the fact of their being engaged to go to Crow Yat,
would furnish an excuse, should Lady Burmester arrive
on Wednesday, as seemed likely, with more invitations
to Melicent.  The vicar was for refusing; but he was
disregarded.  Melicent must be taught the difference
between condescending to drink tea with one's inferiors
and addressing them, when you met them, as equals.
</p>

<p>
The girls were wild with delight when they heard
they were to go.  They all walked to Bensdale Post
Office that afternoon, and Gwen posted a letter.
</p>

<p>
Lady Burmester and Mrs. Helston duly came to tea
at the Vicarage on Wednesday, and were received by
Mrs. Cooper in the gaunt drawing-room&mdash;where she gave
them what the girls were wont to call "pretence tea," as
opposed to a solid, dining-room table arrangement&mdash;in
elegant seclusion.
</p>

<p>
Her flow of amiable small-talk was so unceasing, that
they had been there some twenty minutes before Lady
Burmester, warned by recent error, could get in a
request to see "your girls and Miss Lutwyche."
</p>

<p>
It was another quarter of an hour before Maddie,
Gwen and Melicent appeared.  Mrs. Cooper presented
her girls to her ladyship, with the air of one showing
off a promising baby; and Mrs. Helston drew Melicent
to the window, to try and get a word unheard.
</p>

<p>
"Melicent, I have news for you," she said&mdash;"news
which I think you will be glad to hear.  We are not
leaving Fransdale when we leave the Grange.  Sir
Joseph has let to us, furnished, for a month, the sweetest
cottage you ever saw."
</p>

<p>
Melicent's eyes glowed
</p>

<p>
"Then I can come and see you," she began; but,
checking herself, sighed.  "That is, if Aunt Minna
lets me.  But she is so curious.  She treats me like
a prisoner.  I am never allowed to go out alone.  Are
all English girls like that?  Do you know, it does
irritate me so."
</p>

<p>
"A lovely view from this window, isn't it?" said the
suave voice of Aunt Minna, just behind.  "Melicent,
darling, go and fetch that curious photo of Slabbert's
Poort to show Lady Burmester."
</p>

<p>
Melicent, with one glance at her friend, went off as
desired.  Mrs. Cooper beamed upon her visitor, and
spoke confidentially.
</p>

<p>
"I am very hopeful of Melicent&mdash;very," she affirmed,
as though someone had just expressed a contrary
opinion.  "Her faults may be turned into virtues, I
feel sure.  Her obstinacy will develop into firmness,
when she has learned to obey."
</p>

<p>
Mindful of her desire to conciliate, Mrs. Helston
smiled, as she said:
</p>

<p>
"I feel sure you realise how hard it must be for a
girl who has been the mainstay of a delicate father for
years, to bear restraint."
</p>

<p>
"We know, don't we," cooed Mrs. Cooper, with her
little eyes almost shut, "that obedience is the
foundation-stone of all training."
</p>

<p>
"Melicent's training seems to me to have risen far
above the foundations of character," said Mrs. Helston,
unable to help speaking with some warmth.
</p>

<p>
"Have you girls of your own, Mrs. Helston?" with
an intonation of condescending pity.  Then, playfully:
"Ah, well; it makes all the difference, you know."
</p>

<p>
Melicent reappeared at this moment, and Mrs. Helston
telegraphed to Lady Burmester: "Hopeless!  Let's go."
</p>

<p>
Her ladyship rose and discharged the arrow in her quiver.
</p>

<p>
"I come with an invitation from Sir Joseph, which
I must deliver," she said.  "We are all going to
Clairvaulx Priory Ruins on Monday, as Mr. and
Mrs. Helston leave us the following day.  Sir Joseph hopes
to see yourself, the vicar, your three elder girls and
Miss Lutwyche.  We will send the waggonette and pair
for you at half-past ten, unless it is wet."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper began to reply, with beaming smiles.
</p>

<p>
"What an enchanting idea!  What a pity that
Monday should be the beginning of the week, when
it was specially important that nothing should interfere
with lessons!  Had it been another day, later on&mdash;a
picnic was the most delightful of expeditions.  But her
girls were at an age when she must be very firm, and
she was afraid&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But at this point the vicar walked in, and on the
invitation being conveyed to him, accepted it at once
and unreservedly, for them all.  He accompanied the
ladies to their carriage, saw them drive away, and
returned to the drawing-room where his wife awaited
him by the tea-table.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Aidmund," she began; but he cut in.
</p>

<p>
"It is most short-sighted policy on your part, Minna,
to affront Lady Burmester."
</p>

<p>
"But, my darling boy, the discipline of the
schoolroom&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I believe to be excellent, but it must give way
sometimes," replied her darling boy.  "It is of primary
importance that we should be on good terms with the
Grange.  You had your way about the Dow invitation.
Let me have mine about this."
</p>

<p>
"Well, at any rate," said his wife, after a pause,
"I have taught her ladyship not to invite my niece
and exclude my daughters!  A little firmness, dear
Aidmund, as I often tell you, works wonders!"

CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
A CLEVESHIRE TEA-PARTY
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
"And how came Miss Matilda not to marry him?" asked I.
</p>

<p class="intro2">
"Oh, I don't know.  She was willing enough, I think; but you
know, Cousin Thomas would not have been enough of a gentleman
for the rector and Miss Jenkyns."
</p>

<p class="intro2">
"Well!  But they were not to marry him," said I impatiently.
</p>

<p class="intro2">
"No; but they did not like Miss Matty to marry below her
rank.  You know, she was the rector's daughter, and somehow
they are related to Sir Peter Arley; Miss Jenkyns thought a deal
of that."
</p>

<p class="intro2">
"Poor Miss Mattie!" said I.
</p>

<p class="intro2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;CRANFORD (Mrs. Gaskell).<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The plentiful experiments, by various nations of late, in
the difficult science of government by a democracy, have
left some of us strongly of opinion that the ideal form of
rule would be the despotism of the angel.
</p>

<p>
Failing the angel, however, one is reluctantly forced
to the conclusion that despotism of any other kind is
the very ... well, exactly the other thing.
</p>

<p>
The despotism of Mrs. Cooper was growing hard for
Melicent to bear.
</p>

<p>
It was curious to watch the infatuated complacency
with which she daily presided over that tableful of
turbulent young lives, of whose springs of action she
knew, and wished to know, nothing.
</p>

<p>
What she exacted was submission: nothing more.
She did not desire to convince her children's
understandings; only to hinder them from giving expression
to their thoughts.  As they sat in empty silence around
her, while she prattled of trivialities, she congratulated
herself on their docility.  Like the Roman conquerors
of old&mdash;"she made a solitude, and called it peace."
</p>

<p>
Miss Lathom had had the wit to see, within a week
of her first arrival, the kind of service which was
required of her.  It was not asked that she should
approve Mrs. Cooper's judgment; merely that she
should not question it.  So long as she kept the girls
at lessons for the required number of hours, it did not
matter how little they learned.
</p>

<p>
She had adapted herself to circumstances in order to
find a <i>modus vivendi</i>; for she was poor and ignorant,
and would have found it difficult to obtain another post.
But sometimes she was frightened, of late, at the heat
of the fires which she had kindled.
</p>

<p>
The animal side of these big, country-bred, well-fed
girls was strongly developed, and cried for a vent.
Their starved minds gave them no contrast, no
resources.  They were without the influences of
dancing, drilling, tennis, cycling&mdash;without the stimulus
of sheer hard brain-work, the thrilling interests of
school-life and girl-friendships.  There was nothing to
stem the flood of their growing consciousness of sex.
Gwen especially, vigorous and full-blooded, had arrived
at a dangerous crisis.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Melicent was beginning to find life empty
and depressing.
</p>

<p>
From the moment of the arrival of Mrs. Dow's
invitation, her cousins discussed Lance Burmester,
Alfred Dow, and young Freshfield, from morning to
night, except for those monosyllabic portions of time
which they spent under their parents' eye.  They talked
of the way these young men walked, the colour of their
eyes, the shape of their collars, the sound of their voices,
their little manners and expressions.  They meant no
harm.  They only needed an outlet for that natural
craving for romance, which their mother thought proper
to ignore.
</p>

<p>
Melicent laboured hard to find a field for her own
superfluous energy.  On the first morning after her
arrival, she had risen early, made her bed, aired her
room, borrowed the housemaid's brush, swept and
dusted.
</p>

<p>
Her aunt did not, for two or three days, discover what
she was doing.  But when she did, she was scandalised.
What would the servants think?  Millie showed herself
inclined to esteem but lightly the possible amazement
of the two clumsy girls who formed the Vicarage staff.
But her domestic efforts were straitly forbidden.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning, awake as usual, and roaming
into the schoolroom while the household slumbered,
she marked her uncle in the kitchen garden at work,
patient and lonely, filling up the hours that must elapse
before he could get his breakfast.  She went and offered
her vacant moments.  He replied that her aunt would
not like it.  She was urgent, and he, wavering, presently
allowed her to help him dig potatoes.  They did not
talk, but she worked with nimble capacity; and when
she appeared again next morning, he surprised in
himself a sneaking feeling of gladness.
</p>

<p>
But that day, Mrs. Cooper discovered the new
pursuit; and it was stopped.
</p>

<p>
Millie, however, was not to be defeated.  She next
turned her attention to her cousin's dress; and, finding
some stuff which had been lying in the house for
months, cut out and made up blouses for Maddie and
Gwen.  This last matutinal pursuit found more favour;
and henceforth the girl's fingers were fully occupied,
though her mind continued to crave.
</p>

<p>
It was in wild spirits that the party started for Crow
Yat, which was a fine old house, standing much lower
down the Dale, and for a wonder, built of red brick, and
not grey stone.  It had been the shooting-lodge and
toy of a baronet of George II.'s time, who had tired of
it, and sold it to Alfred Dow's ancestor.
</p>

<p>
There was a drawing-room with four fine doorways,
the pediments enriched with Adam's mouldings; and
here the stiff-necked, proud old dame received the
Vicarage troop with evident desire to show that she
considered herself fully as good as they, if not better.
</p>

<p>
Alfred, a really first-rate specimen of his class, in that
riding dress which is the natural garb of the well-to-do
Dalesman&mdash;who does not drive on his unspeakable roads
unless obliged&mdash;atoned for his mother's lack of cordiality
by the sincerity of his welcome.
</p>

<p>
He led them through the garden, gathering late roses
and dahlias with a lavish hand; then in among the
deep lush orchard grass, filling their hands with
delicious apples.  He sent a boy up the meadow to
gather mushrooms for them to take home; but on
Melicent's vehemently expressed wish, laughingly
allowed them to do it for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Then, at the clanging of a great bell, they came back
to the house, where, in the elegant, panelled dining-parlour,
sat Mrs. Dow, presiding over a real Cleveshire
tea&mdash;jam tarts, cheese-cakes, currant sandwiches,
cartwheels, turnovers&mdash;pastry in all its forms; ham that
must be tasted to be thoroughly appreciated, cut in
wafer slices; heather honey in the comb; peaches,
great, luscious, Victoria plums, black Hamburg grapes,
the despair of Sir Joseph's head gardener, who every
year saw "they Dows" take the prize over his head at
the annual show.
</p>

<p>
Had Melicent been a little older, she would have been
amused at the keenness of the old lady's scrutiny&mdash;her
suspicious glances from one to the other in search of
charms which should explain her son's sudden interest
in the Vicarage lasses, an idea fully as repugnant to her
as it could have been to the outraged Mrs. Cooper.
</p>

<p>
To look at the fine young man, with his good
physique, excellent morals and clean ancestry, was
to make one wonder what better fate would be likely
to await one of these ordinary, ill-educated girls,
samples of thousands of their kind scattered over the
land.  And, had the vicar's niece read "Cranford," she
might have thought of the silent tragedy of Thomas
Holbrook and little Miss Matty.
</p>

<p>
It was a satisfaction to Mrs. Dow that Alfred took
more notice of Melicent than of any of the Miss Coopers.
She took her for about the same age as the vicar's
youngest; such a child could not be dangerous.
</p>

<p>
All tea-time young Dow was trying to draw her out,
a task which was never easy; but every time he coaxed
her out of a statement about Boers and their ways, he
roared with appreciation of her crisp, incisive style.
</p>

<p>
Tea was half over when a horse was heard to clatter
into the stable-yard.  Melicent, who happened to be
seated exactly opposite Gwen, saw her face suddenly
suffused with an overwhelming, unbecoming blush.  A
minute later, a shadow darkened the window, and a
voice called in greeting.  It was Freshfield.
</p>

<p>
Of course he was invited in to tea, and he expressed
himself greatly surprised at the company he found.
Gwen had managed to seat herself near one end of the
table, an empty chair beside her; to which the agent
gravitated naturally.
</p>

<p>
The conversation flagged, somehow.  The rules
under which they lived made the girls tongue-tied
when in company.  Madeline, at nearly eighteen, had
no glimmering of the necessity that is laid upon the
well-bred to set others at their ease.  They were all
gauche and heavy, and ate largely.
</p>

<p>
Tea over, a move was made to the fold-yard to see
the beasts; and this done, someone suggested hide-and-seek.
Miss Lathom demurred at this; she was uneasy
at Freshfield's coming, though she had been privy to
his being apprised of their whereabouts.  She said with
some decision that she was quite sure the vicar would
not like it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, look here, Tommy," said Mr. Freshfield,
with engaging familiarity, "the vicar must jolly well
not be told.  See?  I hear from all those girls what a
trump you are."
</p>

<p>
Under this pressure, Tommy yielded.  But to the
surprise of all, Millie declined it altogether.
</p>

<p>
"If you are sure Uncle Edmund would not like it, I
shall not do it," she said simply.  "I am always doing
what he doesn't like unintentionally, but I won't do it
on purpose."
</p>

<p>
She quietly went indoors to old Mrs. Dow, whose
dignity and good sense had attracted her.  This was a
nature she could understand, a woman who thought no
household work beneath her.  Mrs. Dow, flattered,
offered to show her the dairy.  She had made no doubt
that so small and pale a thing was town-bred, and was
soon filled with astonishment at the knowledge and
capacity displayed by the girl.  Alfred, coming in,
found them discussing the rival methods of African and
English farms with much vigour.  He came to ask
Millie to go and look at some new plantations which,
just now, were his particular delight.  But as soon
as they were out of hearing, he turned to her as if
seizing a chance, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Should you be angry if I ask whether there's
anything between your cousin and young Freshfield?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not angry," said Millie; "but I know nothing
about it.  I can't tell you anything."
</p>

<p>
He took off his cap to run his fingers through his
curls, which was a habit Millie had seen her cousins
mimic.
</p>

<p>
"I had a mind to ask you to warn her; think she'd
take it?" he asked.  "Warn her that he's not in earnest;
he's just playing.  She's raw and doesn't see over-many
young men.  But I know for a fact that he's engaged
to a girl with a bit o' money."
</p>

<p>
"Then why does he flirt with Gwen?"
</p>

<p>
"From something he let drop&mdash;something I heard
him say&mdash;I think he has a bit of a grudge against the
vicar.  Thinks vicar looks down on him.  Would like
to put a spoke in his wheel."
</p>

<p>
Melicent made a small sound of dismay.  "What a
cad!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I think."
</p>

<p>
"It shows my uncle to have been right in holding a
low opinion of him," was the contemptuous verdict.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, but you hit straight!" he returned, in admiration.
"Only, if he'd been better treated the cur wouldn't bite."
</p>

<p>
They had no chance to say more, for two of the girls,
all shyness now wholly cast aside, came charging down
the path, and with shrieks warned them to make a dash
for home.
</p>

<p>
Melicent was left in great discomfort.  She had
knowledge which she could not tell what to do with.
She felt, rather than knew, that to warn Gwen would be
worse than futile; especially now, when her refusal to
play hide-and-seek had irritated all the girls against
her, as well as Tommy, whose conscience was sore, and
who consequently was for once downright ill-tempered.
</p>

<p>
Melicent had a dreary walk home.  She would have
been utterly discouraged but for the fact that she was
to see the Helstons again on Monday; and some
chance there must be that day for her to tell her friends
all that was in her heart.
</p>

<p>
Life at the Vicarage was too aimless.  She had one
hundred pounds of her very own, and she was determined
somehow to make this yield her two years' good
schooling.

CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
THE BREAKING OF BOUNDS
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "And I, so young then, was not sullen.  Soon<br>
  I used to get up early, just to sit<br>
  And watch the morning quicken in the grey,<br>
  And hear the silence open like a flower,<br>
  Leaf after leaf&mdash;and stroke with listless hand<br>
  The woodbine through the window."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Melicent's little bedroom was her sole refuge; and
this her aunt, in her petty tyranny, denied her as often
as she could.  It was her theory that solitude was bad
for girls.  She liked them to be always herded together,
under the eye of Tommy or one of their parents.
Melicent must work, write, read, in the constant babble
and racket of the schoolroom.  The first time she found
her niece curled up in the window-seat of her own room
with a book, she swooped upon her with her sweetest
smile, to see what the volume was.  On discovering it
to be "Alison's History of Europe," she shifted her
attack from the reading to the spot where it took place.
It was a draughty window; dear Melicent had better go
into the warm schoolroom.
</p>

<p>
Melicent felt her tongue tingle to resent this aimless
autocracy.  The window of her little room was dear to
her.  It overlooked the grey stable-yard, with the
glowing copper of autumn beeches, the dazzling gold of
birches, peeping over the further wall, flanked by black
Scotch firs, whose trunks seemed to glow red-hot when
the sun was in the west; and behind them lay the long
purple ridge&mdash;Weary Ridge&mdash;that fenced Fransdale
away from the world on the eastern side.
</p>

<p>
The window was quite close to one inner corner of
the quadrangle formed by the house and outbuildings.
At right angles to it was the warm, dry, stone barn, on
the upper floor of which the old mare's fodder was
stored.  There was a door, the upper half of which had
a wooden shutter, on a level with Melicent's casement;
and running up to this, one of those exterior flights of
stone steps, so common in Cleveshire stable-yards.
</p>

<p>
Melicent felt sure that it would not be difficult, if
there were something to hold by, to swing herself out of
the window, upon the rectangular slab of stone, which
was only a little to the left.  In this way she could get
out, if ever her longing for a solitary ramble overcame
her.  The gate of the yard was locked at night, but she
knew were the key hung; and at times her longing to
be free and away on the magical moors was like a voice
calling, or a force drawing her.
</p>

<p>
There were only four windows overlooking the stable-yard;
one was on the landing, one was her own, and
the remaining two belonged to the boys' room, which
was of course, during term, untenanted.
</p>

<p>
On Thursday night, her head full of what Mr. Dow
had said about Gwen, she found herself unable to sleep,
and actually carried out her plan.  There was a staple,
securely fixed in the wall, just by her window.  To this
she firmly attached a bit of rope's end with a loop.
Sitting on the sill, and jumping lightly to the left, she
alighted on the verge of the stone slab, and, holding
firmly to her rope, swung herself round, got her balance,
and stood safely.  It was easy to slip round the two
dark sides of the yard and open the gate.  When it
was shut behind her, and she stood under the wall, in
the grass of the church meadow, she felt herself swallowed
up in the immensity of the night.
</p>

<p>
For an hour she wandered in the little wood, and sat
by the side of the tributary beck, rushing noisily over its
stony bed to join the trout stream below.  Then, no
longer restless, she quietly returned, accomplished, not
without difficulty, her re-entry, and creeping into bed,
was instantly asleep.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that she mentioned her exploit in the
course of the following day to her cousins.  They were
all cross and out of sorts, their mother having forbidden
a walk to Bensdale that day&mdash;Bensdale, where there
awaited them an instalment of a new serial&mdash;Phyllis
and the Duke having been duly united by an archbishop
in the bonds of matrimony, amid a blaze of splendour
and a pageant of ancestral halls.
</p>

<p>
"We might just as well live in a prison," grumbled
Maddie.
</p>

<p>
"Prisons are not so easy to get out of," replied
Melicent: "If you dislike it so, why don't you run
away, and decline to come back unless they make
terms?"
</p>

<p>
"Run away!" they all cried; and Gwen added, with
a sneer: "Why don't you try, if it's so easy?"
</p>

<p>
Melicent answered in all good faith:
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't want to seem ungrateful.  I know
it was good of Uncle Edmund to ask me here.  Only,
you see, I don't fit, and I never shall, because I don't
want to be the kind of person that Aunt Minna wants to
make me.  So I shall not stay; but I don't want to
run away in the night, as though they ill-treated me."
</p>

<p>
The girls clamoured to know how she would set about
running away, if it came to that; and she simply told
them that she had been out the night before, and
explained how she managed it.  They listened with
deep interest.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you tell them you went?" they asked.
</p>

<p>
"No; not unless I am asked.  I don't think myself
bound to account to them for every minute of my time."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you played the Pharisee yesterday, and would
not join our game."
</p>

<p>
"I think that's different.  To do what we were
specially told not to do, in front of other people, is
publicly to shame Uncle Edmund and Aunt Minna.
Now my going for a breath of air was quite private;
there was nobody to be scandalised."
</p>

<p>
"Well," observed Babs, "if you had been seen, half
the village would have been scandalised."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," said Melicent thoughtfully.  "I think
I had better not do it any more; but it was very
tempting, just to try."
</p>

<p>
On the following day, Gwen had neuralgia, and was
in great pain.
</p>

<p>
"It's her bed," said Maddie, "it's in such a draught;
and mine's no better.  Mother says it's all right if we
keep the window shut, but we can't sleep with the
window shut, so we always get up and open it, after
she has been in.  I wonder we're not both blown away!
I tell you what, Millie, I wish you'd let her sleep in your
bed just for one night, to get rid of it.  We don't want
to tell mother, or she'll keep her indoors, and perhaps
stop her from going to Clairvaulx on Monday."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course I will!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but remember, we mustn't change till after
mother has been round last thing."
</p>

<p>
"All right; Gwen had better slip in when the coast's
clear," said Melicent unsuspiciously.
</p>

<p>
The change was duly effected, without detection, and
next morning there was no doubt that Gwen's neuralgia
was cured.
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday morning&mdash;a warm, sunny, October
day, and the golden light streamed into the Vicarage
breakfast-room.  The girls were all assembled, waiting
for breakfast, with newly brushed hair and clean frocks.
All looked healthy, cheerful and glad.  But the vicar's
face, as he walked in, was in sharp contrast to the gay
morning.  More than the customary hush descended on
his entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Melicent," he said, greeting nobody, "oblige me by
taking your breakfast into the study.  Eat it there, and
wait till I come."
</p>

<p>
Melicent stood up, staring in surprise.  "Why do
you say this?  What have I done?"
</p>

<p>
"What you have done cannot be so much as alluded
to before your young cousins.  Leave the room at
once."
</p>

<p>
Melicent drew herself up.  She looked round at all
the furtively dropped eyes&mdash;at Gwen's cheeks, oddly
suffused with sudden scarlet&mdash;then at her uncle.
</p>

<p>
"I have done nothing to deserve to be so spoken to,"
said she.  "When you find out the truth, I hope you
will apologise to me."
</p>

<p>
"We wish to hear nothing from you, Melicent.  Go
in silence."
</p>

<p>
Tommy behind the tea-tray, and her pupils seated
round, were well-nigh paralysed with terror.  What
had been found out?  Were they implicated?  Would
Melicent obey?
</p>

<p>
She took up her cup and plate, tossed back her hair,
and walked out, white and speechless.  The vicar shut
the door, sat down in the dire silence, and began his
breakfast.  They all chewed their way through chunks
of pork-pie in unbroken gloom.
</p>

<p>
When his daughters had filed away to learn their
collects, their father betook himself to his study and
the culprit.
</p>

<p>
Melicent had finished her breakfast, and stood by the
window.  He sat down at his table, and fixed his eyes
upon her.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, "I suppose, before condemning you,
it is only right to ask you what you have to say."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," said Melicent.  "I
have nothing to say.  I am waiting for you to explain
why you treat me in this manner."
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately," he said, "all is known.  You will
hardly deny that you got out of the window of your
bedroom, when I happened to see you do it."
</p>

<p>
"I do not deny that I did," she returned quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you will tell me why you did so?"
</p>

<p>
"It was partly that I wanted to see whether I could,
and partly that I was restless.  I am used to be out of
doors a great deal more than Aunt Minna likes me to
be."
</p>

<p>
"When I tell you, Melicent, that I know what
happened last night, you should see how much worse
you are making things by quibbling like this."
</p>

<p>
"Last night!  But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We are speaking of last night."
</p>

<p>
"I am not.  The only time I got out of the window
was on Thursday night."
</p>

<p>
"Do you seriously mean to tell me that you did not
get out of the window last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly!  I did not."
</p>

<p>
He sat staring; and in the pause that followed,
enlightenment came to Melicent, and she wondered
at her own blindness.  Gwen had asked to sleep in
her room, in order to get out of the window!
</p>

<p>
That being so, she could not clear herself without
incriminating her cousin; and in a flash she saw that
if she said Gwen and she had changed beds the
previous night, the others would all deny it.  Her
mind, travelling with the speed that comes in moments
of crisis, discerned the strength of the case against her.
Even Tommy did not know of last night's escapade.
Both she and Mrs. Cooper could say with confidence
that all the girls were in their own beds at half-past
ten on Saturday night.  She wondered at herself for
being deceived by the flimsy pretext of the toothache,
when she thought how unlikely the story would
sound.
</p>

<p>
The girls must deny everything.  They had no other
course.  They had to go on living at home, and such
a thing, if known, would make life impossible, and
turn their prison into a veritable dungeon keep.
</p>

<p>
She, on the contrary, had no intention of remaining
where she was.  Her uncle had already a bad opinion
of her.  To allow it to grow worse seemed the only
course in the dilemma so suddenly developed.
</p>

<p>
After long thought, her uncle spoke, in a gentler
tone than he had ever used to her.
</p>

<p>
"Confession, Melicent," he said, "is the only possible
way to lessen my extreme displeasure.  Last night, or
to be more correct, at two o'clock this morning, I heard
a casement flapping in the wind.  I got up, believing it
to be the landing window, and left my room without a
light, to shut it.  I found it closed, and was on the point
of pushing it open, to look out, and see whence the
noise came, when a movement in the yard below caught
my eye.  Two people were seated, side by side, upon
the stone steps near your window, the window of which
was no doubt causing the disturbance.  One was a man,
the other was my niece.  I saw that the man had his
arm round your waist.  His face I could not distinguish,
but in the light of recent events, I consider myself
justified in supposing it to have been Alfred Dow."
</p>

<p>
The girl's short, indignant laugh, naturally increased
her uncle's idea of her shamelessness.
</p>

<p>
"I saw you"&mdash;he went on&mdash;"I saw you escort him to
the gate, shut and lock it after him, return and scramble
in, by means of a piece of rope, into your bedroom.  I
stood there, broad awake, and saw all this.  After
hearing my story, will you persist in your denial?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, after a minute's thought; "I do not
persist in it."
</p>

<p>
"You admit," he said, with righteous indignation
blazing under the even surface of his voice, "that you
did all this?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the girl; "I do not admit it.  If you saw
it, there is no question of my denying it or admitting it
Either the thing is certain, or you have made a great
mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Why not confess openly, Melicent?"
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing to confess."
</p>

<p>
"This is mere quibbling," he said, still temperately.
"But what you have said I consider tantamount to a
confession.  One thing, and one alone, you can do to
lessen your guilt.  Give me the name of the man who
has violated my home, insulted my office and degraded
my niece."
</p>

<p>
She was silent
</p>

<p>
"You will not?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you will not."
</p>

<p>
"I mean that I cannot."
</p>

<p>
He almost wished that she were a boy, and could be
caned.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you to be wilful and undisciplined," he
said, almost appealingly, "but I am most anxious not
to judge you too harshly, Melicent, for I know what
your bringing up has been.  I will not make too much
of what I hope and pray may have been merely a wild,
rebellious prank.  If you will tell me frankly what you
did, and the man's name&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can't do either."
</p>

<p>
"Then, Melicent, most unwillingly, I must require of
you that you remain in the schoolroom while we are at
church.  Think things over, and by the time we return,
God grant you may be of a better mind.  Come with
me, please."
</p>

<p>
Melicent followed him without a word.

CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
A CRISIS AT THE VICARAGE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "She said sometimes: 'Aurora, have you done<br>
  Your task this morning?  Have you read that book?<br>
  And are you ready for the crochet here?'<br>
  As if she said: 'I know there's something wrong;<br>
  I know I have not ground you down enough<br>
  To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust<br>
  For household uses and proprieties.'"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The schoolroom was empty.  Tommy and her brood
were preparing to go to church.  The vicar laid a little
book upon the table and addressed a few sincere words
to the girl.  Narrow he was, prejudiced be might be;
but a man who, however mistaken, is quite sincere, has
always some power.  Melicent felt that, had she been
to blame, she might have repented at his bidding.
</p>

<p>
It was not expected that the party from the Grange
would be at Fransdale Church that day.  Mrs. Cooper
was inly disconcerted when she saw that they were there.
She found their inquiries after Melicent, when service
was over, difficult to parry.
</p>

<p>
"A little <i>disagreement</i>?" she murmured, smiling,
meaningly, and speaking as though taking Mrs. Helston into
special confidence&mdash;always her manner when she was
not telling the truth&mdash;"just a little question of discipline
between dear Melicent and her uncle.  We must hope
for the best; but it needs much patience and kindness
to eradicate the results of such training."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Helston, though furious, realised that no
indignation on her part would help Melicent's cause.  She
longed to ask questions, but knew she had no right to
interfere in the matter at all.  Mrs. Cooper, smiling and
chattering, got away with adroitness on which she
prided herself, with no questions asked as to whether
Melicent would be allowed to go to the picnic next
day.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Tommy and her pupils were in a terrible
panic.  They dared not guess what had been found
out.  Gwen, on considering the matter, could not believe
it possible that it could be her last night's escapade,
because, if her father had by some mysterious means
seen anything, she felt sure that he would have taken
the culprit in the act.  By no means a student of
character, she forgot that he never took action in the
heat of the moment.  They all crept home from church
with shaken nerves, fully expecting that the storm
would burst on their return.  But nothing happened.
Whatever Melicent's offence, she had certainly not
incriminated them.
</p>

<p>
They were all so burdened by guilty consciences
that, had it been their custom to be natural before their
parents, anybody could have seen that something was
wrong.  However there was nothing unusual, at the
Vicarage, in embarrassed, sulky silence, or monosyllabic
answers: so all passed off without disturbance, and
they were free to stare at one another in the seclusion
of the schoolroom, from which the captive was now
removed, and ask what could possibly be "up."
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Cooper were meanwhile at a loss.  It
was certain that they could not keep their niece among
their own children, but what other course was feasible?
They could not afford to support her at school.  She
was too young to be turned out to get her own living,
not to mention the probability of her disgracing herself
and them, wherever they placed her.
</p>

<p>
Her aunt went in during the afternoon, and tried her
blandishments, but was confronted with a steady, cold
assertion that the girl had nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
That night, Melicent slept in another room, with a
screwed-down window and a locked door; and in the
solitude she broke down utterly, and wept pitifully for
her dead father.  She yearned for the presence of
somebody she knew&mdash;somebody that believed in
her; she even thought, with a gust of something like
tenderness, of Bert Mestaer himself.
</p>

<p>
But in the morning, when her aunt brought her
breakfast, she was self-contained and proud as ever.
She heard the waggonette from the Grange drive up to
the door, in dazzling sunshine.  From her window she
saw it pass out of the gate, after a twenty minute's
delay caused by Mrs. Cooper's not being ready&mdash;saw
Maddie, Gwen and Theo, in the new blouses she had
made and hats which she had trimmed.
</p>

<p>
They had not been long gone before the key turned
in the lock and Tommy crept in.  She looked flurried
and eager.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear," she gasped, "at last I have a moment!
Do tell me what has occurred!"
</p>

<p>
Melicent laid down her book and looked up, "Has
Uncle Edmund not told you anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Not anything!"
</p>

<p>
"Then of course I can't."
</p>

<p>
"Really, Melicent, you are an impracticable girl!
How can we help you if we don't know the scrape
you're in?"
</p>

<p>
"You can't help me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well!" huffily.  "I came to let you out, and
say that of course Babs and Bee and I should not
tell, and you might just as well come and sit in the
schoolroom with us."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind, Miss Lathom, but I shall stay
here.  I don't cheat."
</p>

<p>
"I can guess what it is," observed Tommy, with an
air of penetration.  "Your uncle has found out that
you got out of window!"
</p>

<p>
There was no reply.
</p>

<p>
"I thought so!" said Tommy triumphantly.  "I
was sure of it!  That would be just the thing to make
him angry.  But I must say, I think they're punishing
you too severely, considering you were shut up all
yesterday.  However, cheer up, my dear!  These
things blow over, you know."
</p>

<p>
"You're very kind," said Melicent wearily, "but I
think you'd better go away.  I feel sure they told you
not to come and talk to me, didn't they?"
</p>

<p>
Tommy grew red.
</p>

<p>
"You're an ungrateful little cat," she said.  "I come
here trying to be kind to you, and I daresay you'll go
and tell tales of me!"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know by now that I don't tell tales,"
said Melicent; "but as I can hardly ever speak the truth
here without telling tales, the only thing I can do is to
hold my tongue."
</p>

<p>
Miss Lathom flounced out of the room in a rage.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the Vicarage party met with a very cool
reception when they arrived at Clairvaulx.
</p>

<p>
Lady Burmester clearly showed her displeasure.
</p>

<p>
"Surely you are too hard upon a girlish fault,"
she said stiffly.  "If Melicent was in punishment all
yesterday, you might have relented to-day, when you
knew how anxious we all are to have her."
</p>

<p>
"If you knew the gravity of my niece's fault," said
the vicar, in his most distant manner, "you would,
I believe, think differently.  She has proved herself
altogether an unfit companion for innocent girls, and
must, I fear, be sent to some institution where the
moral sense may be developed by constant supervision."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" said Sir Joseph.
</p>

<p>
The six elders were standing together, the girls
having strayed off in company with Lancelot and
Mr. Freshfield.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Helston's cheeks were crimson.
</p>

<p>
"Will you think we ask too much if we beg to be
told what she has done?" she inquired, in a voice that
shook.
</p>

<p>
"Our claim to know is a strong one," put in her
husband, "as, if Mr. Mayne consents, we should like to
undertake the child's education, and give her a home.
We hoped that, as you have plenty of daughters, and
we have none, you would perhaps spare her to us, who
have grown attached to her.  But we ought to be in a
position to know what tendencies in her to guard
against."
</p>

<p>
"I presume," said the vicar, "that you would rather
that we did not speak before Sir Joseph and Lady
Burmester."
</p>

<p>
Her ladyship laid her hand on her husband's arm,
and led him away across the grass.
</p>

<p>
"If I were a girl," she said, "the very sight of
Mrs. Cooper would make me wicked.  She makes my flesh
creep.  I wish somebody would take out her ear-rings."
</p>

<p>
"You are an ungenerous, ill-regulated woman," said
Sir Joseph placidly.  "I daresay they've had a sweet
time of it, trying to break in Harry's precious African
filly.  He hints at her having had a past already.
I expect she's a bit of a fire-brand in a peaceful
parsonage."
</p>

<p>
The four others strolled in an opposite direction.
The vicar, with real reluctance, and with brevity,
described what he had seen Melicent do.
</p>

<p>
"I do not believe it!" cried Brenda Helston hotly.
</p>

<p>
"Brenda!" cried her husband, while Mrs. Cooper
grew pink, and trembled visibly.
</p>

<p>
"It was one of the maids masquerading," went on
Brenda, unheeding.  "The very idea of Melicent doing
such a thing is outrageous!  One of the maids used her
window to get out by!  I daresay she sleeps soundly."
</p>

<p>
The vicar had had his moment in which to collect
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately," he said, "my niece does not deny it."

CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
A NEW HOME
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "&mdash;&mdash;Many, I believe there are,<br>
  Who live a life of virtuous decency,<br>
  Men who can hear the Decalogue, and feel<br>
  No self-reproach; who of the moral law<br>

  Are strict observers; and not negligent<br>
  In acts of love to those with whom they dwell,<br>
  Their kindred and the children of their blood.<br>
  Praise be to such, and to their slumbers, peace!<br>
  &mdash;But of the poor man ask, the abject poor;<br>
  Go and demand of him, if there be here,<br>
  In this cold abstinence from evil deeds;<br>
  And these inevitable charities,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;WORDSWORTH.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was getting dusk&mdash;too dusk to see to read the
"History of Europe"; and Melicent, who had scarcely slept
all night, stretched herself upon her bed and fell asleep.
The flash of a light in her eyes awoke her, and starting
up, she saw her uncle come in with a lamp, followed by
Mr. and Mrs. Helston.
</p>

<p>
She gave a low, thrilling cry, like that of a babe who
sees its mother.  She had not expected this.  The vicar
had never seen her look as she did when running to her
friends' arms.  He set down the lamp and left them
together.
</p>

<p>
It was long, however, before they could persuade her
to tell them anything.  They were obliged to make her
clearly understand the serious nature of the charge
against her.  They showed how essential it was to
remove such a stigma.  They guessed at once that she
was shielding someone; and after much urgent entreaty,
she was induced to tell them all, and leave the upshot to
their discretion.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure," she said, when she had related the whole
story, "that it would not be the least use to tell them
the truth; for two reasons.  First, they would think the
bare idea of Gwen's behaving like that simply ridiculous.
Aunt Minna thinks they are all babies, and talks
to them as if they could hardly understand what she
says; and they mimic her afterwards.  Second, because
all the girls would deny it.  It would be my word against
Maddie and Gwen.  Which do you think they would
take?"
</p>

<p>
"There would be somebody else," observed Harry
Helston firmly.  "Young Freshfield.  I know Sir Joseph
has been dissatisfied lately, and he will have about
settled his hash if any of this gets about.  The thing
is&mdash;how to trap him?  There will be no more chance for
Gwen to use that window, I take it?"
</p>

<p>
"He would still go on writing to her at Bensdale
under cover to Tommy, I expect&mdash;but oh, you must
not say anything about it!  You don't know how awful
it would be!  Tommy would be sent away; they would
lead the most weary life&mdash;wear chains on their ankles, I
should think."
</p>

<p>
"But, dear," said Brenda gently, "what is to happen
if this is allowed to go on?  Gwen does not know what
she is doing.  Suppose she came to harm, what should
we feel, who had never warned them of her danger?
Now I think of it, I noticed little things between her
and that man once or twice to-day.  But she is so
unformed, and&mdash;to me&mdash;so unattractive, that I never
thought of such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"She's rather a handsome girl," said her husband.
</p>

<p>
And now Melicent exhausted her eloquence to
implore them not to say anything.
</p>

<p>
"You see, it will only make them worse," she said.
"If they were trusted, they would be all right; if they
were given credit for good sense and good feeling, they
would be quite different.  But they are treated like
fools, who would be knaves if they were allowed their
own way, and it just makes them treacherous&mdash;they
must have an outlet!  It's only for adventure and
frolic that Gwen did it&mdash;it's the only thing they have
to think about&mdash;they're not allowed to read or think, or
do anything but just vegetate; how can such a life
content them?  And now, if this is known, they will be
all the more shut in and tied up, and crushed down,
and I shouldn't wonder if it drove them to do something
really wrong."
</p>

<p>
This view of the subject constituted a real difficulty.
Revelation would merely tighten the prison-bars, and
would so increase the very evil it was intended to
remove.  A more perplexing problem had never been
offered to the Helstons.
</p>

<p>
They put it resolutely away from them for a time, in
order to tell Melicent about their own plans for her
future.  They told her that they hoped to receive, in
about a fortnight's time, Carol Mayne's formal
permission to take charge of her for the present.
</p>

<p>
They had some private means, but did not consider
themselves rich enough to justify them in adopting her
entirely.  In all respects, they thought it would be doing
her a truer kindness to educate her with a view to making
her independent.  Harry Helston, artist and dreamer
by temperament, was architect by profession.  He had
spent so much time in travelling the world, and
absorbing the idea of all the masterpieces of his great
profession, that his fortune was by no means made.  It
was perhaps a drawback to him professionally, that of
him it might be said as of a certain statesman who
"thought in continents," that he, Harry Helston,
"thought in cathedrals."  The ornamental suburban
residence, with its nurseries chopped away in chunks
to make the external elevation picturesque, was his pet
abomination.  He would do no work, where cheapness
was to be the marring key-note.  Simplicity and the
best craftsmanship were his mottoes.  His work lay in
London, where he and his wife, after their travels, were
about to take a flat.  But he was also now determined
to fulfil his youthful ambitions, and build for himself the
house of his dreams in Fransdale itself.
</p>

<p>
Sir Joseph, who was a byword in the district for his
stern refusal to sell or lease land for building purposes,
had relented in his case; and the home of his imagination
was to arise in a level meadow half-way down the
Dale&mdash;a pleasure house for holiday hours&mdash;a final refuge
for old age.
</p>

<p>
For the austere mystery of the North had made him
as completely a captive as was Melicent herself.
</p>

<p>
The girl could hardly believe that she was to visit
every year, in the company of those she loved best, the
Dale which had gripped her fancy so powerfully.  The
Helstons were to rent, until their own house should be
built, the tiny cottage upon which Melicent had looked
down, when she sat upon Tod's Trush.  The darkness
of her misery was all changed into pure joy by the time
her friends took leave.
</p>

<p>
Before Mr. Helston lay the formidable necessity of
seeing Mr. Cooper.  He was fairly perplexed.  Should
he speak, or not?  He found himself wondering what
advice Mr. Hall, of Ilberston, would be likely to give.  But
there was no time for reflection.  He left his wife still
with Melicent, and found himself in the study without
having made up his mind as to his duty.  His intention
flickered to and fro like a candle in the wind.  Was he
shirking truth because it was disagreeable?  Or was
he contemplating an unwarrantable interference into
another man's affairs?  Was he justified in giving
information which would result in deeper mismanagement
of those unaccountable beings, young girls?  Or
if he stood aloof, was he guilty of Cain-like indifference
to his brother's peril?
</p>

<p>
He sat down in more discomfort than he ever remembered
to have suffered before.  His indignation that
Melicent should suffer under any kind of stigma made
another powerful factor in his desires; and he did not
know for how much he ought to let it weigh.  As he
looked at Mr. Cooper's cold, dark face, he was conscious
of a desire to demand that, as it had been publicly
announced that Melicent was in disgrace, so it should
be publicly known that she was cleared.  But he felt
pretty sure of the difficulty there would be in establishing
the truth.  He saw a distinct likeness between the
vicar and his niece; he had seen the same hard glint
in Melicent's eye when she was on the defensive.  The
Coopers gave him the idea of being always on the
defensive&mdash;on the watch to parry and frustrate any
attempts upon their confidence or their intimacy.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be glad to hear that you have elicited any
information that may tend to Melicent's rehabilitation,"
said the vicar, in tones wholly devoid of expectancy.
</p>

<p>
Helston found himself speaking without having in
the least determined what he meant to say.
</p>

<p>
"Melicent has told us what she knows," he said.
"We think it clears her.  But we respect her motive
for silence, and are inclined to think that no good end
could be served by telling you what she told us."
</p>

<p>
The vicar looked stony.  "But I think I must ask to
hear it," he said.
</p>

<p>
"It was told us in confidence.  Melicent is&mdash;is
content to feel that we know it.  I&mdash;I am not sure
that I am entitled to let it go further."
</p>

<p>
The cold, blue eye still fixed him.
</p>

<p>
"You convey to me the idea that Melicent is
shielding someone else.  Is this so?"
</p>

<p>
Helston twirled his soft hat idly in his hands, and
looked at the ground.
</p>

<p>
"I do not feel at liberty to say," he said at length.
</p>

<p>
"If that be so, the person shielded must be a member
of my household," said the vicar, in a voice which
sounded to Helston like the crackling of ice in a hard
frost.  "I suppose you can scarcely be venturing to
insinuate that it was one of my daughters?"
</p>

<p>
"I insinuate nothing; I do not know who it was.  It
was not Melicent."
</p>

<p>
"Far be it from me," said Mr. Cooper, after reflection,
"to traduce or speak ill of my sister's child; but if she
has resorted to the desperate expedient of trying to
fasten blame upon one of my poor girls, I must
reluctantly lower still further my opinion of her.  I fear
you and Mrs. Helston are altogether deceived in her."
</p>

<p>
"We are willing to take the risk," said Helston
immediately, "and to relieve you of the charge of
her to-morrow, if you are willing."  His eyes twinkled
as he added: "We have no daughters to be
contaminated."
</p>

<p>
"Had it not been so, I could not in honour have
allowed you to undertake the charge of her.  I am
quite frank with you.  I tell you plainly that I will in
no case keep her among my own girls; and I do not
know how to meet the cost of maintaining her
elsewhere.  If you, knowing what you know, are willing to
take her, my feelings can but be those of gratitude and
relief."
</p>

<p>
"Then we may consider it settled!" cried Helston,
rising.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps his haste betrayed how he was yearning to
get away, for a look of suspicion crossed the vicar's
face.
</p>

<p>
"Do you not think I have a right to ask you to be
more explicit?" he said.
</p>

<p>
His visitor looked down, and it was after an interval
that he slowly said:
</p>

<p>
"You have a right.  I ask you to waive it.  What I
have heard rests wholly upon Melicent's word, which, I
understand, you do not trust."
</p>

<p>
The vicar could not say that he did.
</p>

<p>
"You would not take her word against that of your
own children?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not!"
</p>

<p>
"That is natural enough; but it convinces me that
there is no more to be said."
</p>

<p>
The vicar looked down, thinking deeply.  Then
abruptly, and perhaps with the deliberate idea of
taking the other by surprise, he demanded:
</p>

<p>
"She would not tell you the name of the man?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no man in the world to whom she would
accord a clandestine meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you forget that I was an eye-witness,
Mr. Helston."
</p>

<p>
"Would you swear in a court of law that the girl
whom you saw was Melicent?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Why," asked Helston, "did you not at once enter
her room, and convince yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"I never act in haste; besides, there is no doubt.
She wore Melicent's hat&mdash;a kind of broad, flat cap
which she wears in the garden; and she entered her
room!  Mr. Helston, I fear I must ask you to be
explicit.  You have said too much, or not enough.
What is it you suggest?"
</p>

<p>
"I suggest nothing, for I know nothing, except the
fact, of which I am sure, that the girl you saw was not
Melicent.  Had you gone to her room, and confronted
her then and there, you would have known more than
I do at this moment."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are bound to tell me what my niece
has told you," said the vicar; and a new uneasiness
was in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"No; I am not bound to, and I have no wish to.
But there is a further question, as to whether I ought
to.  I&mdash;I can't speak without inflicting great pain,
which I am very loath to do.  But I can't get away
from the feeling that perhaps I ought not to allow you
to go on in ignorance of the true state of affairs.
Perhaps I have said enough to put you on your guard.
Let us leave it so."
</p>

<p>
"No;" the answer came at once and firmly.  "We
cannot leave it so.  You must tell me the tale which
my niece has poured into your ears, in simple justice
to me and mine.  If Melicent has slandered her
cousins, she should be punished."
</p>

<p>
"Equally, if they have allowed her to suffer for them,
they should be punished," said Helston, stung at last.
"May I ask if you have made any sort of inquiry
among them?"
</p>

<p>
"Decidedly not.  I have not allowed them even to
know the way this misguided girl has behaved."
</p>

<p>
Helston hardly knew whether most to pity or be
enraged at such blindness.  He turned away and walked
to the window.  The girls were just passing through the
garden on their way from feeding their rabbits.  They
all glanced in a furtive way at the study windows, and
Gwendolen met his eyes fully.  She averted her face in
confusion, and hurried on.  The visitor turned abruptly
to the vicar and took leave.  He could not trust
himself to say another word.  Mr. Cooper accompanied
him to the hall door, and they found themselves
suddenly face to face with Gwen, coming in.
</p>

<p>
Her father, in a marked way, encircled her with his
arm, as if to show his confidence.  The girl was
trembling, scarlet, deeply moved.  She turned upon
Helston.
</p>

<p>
"Then she held her tongue?" she gulped out.  "She
has not split, even now?"
</p>

<p>
Helston's face lit up.
</p>

<p>
"Does that touch you, Miss Cooper?" he asked kindly.
</p>

<p>
"It does.  I'm most things that are bad, but I
simply can't be such a sneak as this.  Father!  It
was I, not Melicent, whom you saw in the yard!
And you may thrash me, or starve me, or do what
you like with me, but I will never tell you the name
of the man who was with me!  Oh, Melicent isn't
the only person in this house with any sense of honour!
She's&mdash;she's&mdash;taught me a lesson!  You tell her from
me, Mr. Helston, that if I'm ever any good in this
world, it'll be all owing to her."
</p>

<p>
The vicar had not said one word.  He stood where
he was, the arm which his daughter had shaken off rigid
against his side.  His face grew bloodless, his expression
a marvellous exhibition of self-control.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Helston kindest to say good-bye and
leave the house hurriedly.  His admiration for Gwendolen
was great; after what Melicent had told him, he
could partly guess the effort it needed to make her
confession&mdash;a confession which must expose not only
her own wrong-doing, but the whole working of a long
system of deceit; for the matter could now hardly
be allowed to rest where it stood.
</p>

<p>
Contact with Melicent's honesty and courage had
stimulated this girl to show herself honest and
courageous.  He felt very hopeful of her future, though
he himself winced at the ordeal now before her.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
AN UNMARKED FESTIVAL
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Day of days!  Unmarked it rose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whose hours we were to meet;<br>
  And forgotten passed.  Who knows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was earth cold, or sunny, sweet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the coming of your feet?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;MRS. MEYNELL.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As her visitor departed, Brenda Helston turned from
the door and let herself sink into an easy-chair by the
fire with a gratified laugh.
</p>

<p>
Five years had not changed her, except that her
soft, abundant hair was whiter.  No wrinkles marred
her smooth pink cheeks, her eyes were still bright,
though her forty-fifth birthday stared her in the face.
</p>

<p>
The room in which she sat&mdash;the drawing-room of her
flat in Collis Square&mdash;was an unusual room.  Harry
Helston strongly held the theory that Londoners must
live inside their walls.  The pictures which hung on
these were all originals and all good.  A line of
bookshelves encircled the room like a dado, the top forming
a shelf for the reception of rare bits of pottery, brass,
<i>cloisonné</i> and curios.  In one corner the line of books
was broken for the admission of a large secretaire.
With this exception, and that of a roomy writing-table
near the fire, the room contained no furniture but
chairs of every variety of comfort, and small solid tables,
holding no ornaments, but convenient for the reception
of cups, books or papers.  There were flowers in every
place where they could be put without risk of being
knocked over.
</p>

<p>
The visitor who had just left the room had gone
unwillingly, but gladdened by a cordial invitation to
return later.  His hostess thought of him with pleasure
and satisfaction.  He was immensely improved by
his term of foreign service, and it was gratifying that
his first visit on reaching London should have been to her.
She had always liked Lance Burmester; and the fact of
his having proved himself so emphatically all that a
Special Correspondent ought to be&mdash;of his having chosen
to have a profession, and to work hard at it, being, as
he was, the eldest son of a wealthy man&mdash;had by no
means lessened her good opinion.
</p>

<p>
She rang the bell, gave some orders to the maid who
answered it, and was still in reverie&mdash;perhaps building
castles in the air&mdash;when her husband came in, chuckling.
</p>

<p>
He held an evening paper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Brenda, here's something that will amuse you," he
said, stooping to kiss her affectionately.
</p>

<p>
She looked up eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I have news for you, Harry!  Guess who has been
here to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll guess afterwards, but first I must read you this.
It's about Melicent.  Won't she be furious?  She did
think she had dodged the halfpenny interviewer."  He
unfolded his copy of the <i>Hauberk</i> and read aloud:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
"'THE LADY ARCHITECT
</p>

<p>
"'The decision of Miss Lutwyche, three years ago,
to complete her course of architectural training by
acquiring a practical knowledge of building, caused a
considerable flutter of the dove-cotes at the Polytechnic
when she applied personally to be enrolled.  There was
no rule, however, by which she could be excluded, and
she has been ever since, the only lady among six
hundred male students.
</p>

<p>
"'Having completed her course, she is now taking steps
to set up for herself, and is to begin by superintending
the erection of two labourers cottages from her own
designs, upon the Cleveshire estates of Sir Joseph
Burmester.  Miss Lutwyche has an intimate knowledge
of the tastes and requirements of the natives of the
district in question, and it is understood that she is
strongly of opinion that the question of the housing
of the poor will ultimately be successfully tackled by
women and not by men.
</p>

<p>
"'Simplicity, durability and convenience are the
keynotes of her work.  It is known that she had much to
do with the erection of the wonderful house which
her adopted father, Mr. Helston, F.R.I.B.A., has just
completed in Fransdale, which has been described as
the most imaginative specimen of domestic architecture
produced by an Englishman during the last three
hundred years.  It has been seriously suggested that
the house in question may revolutionise the idea of the
English country house, and that the day of gables,
barge-boards, rough-casting and timbering is over.'"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They looked at each other in mischievous amusement.
</p>

<p>
"She <i>will</i> be angry," said Brenda; and, after a
moment's silence, burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Think I'd better not show it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you must let her see it; because, if you don't,
someone else will&mdash;inevitably."
</p>

<p>
Helston leaned back in his chair, with reminiscent
eyes fixed on the glowing fire.
</p>

<p>
"You and I were right, Brenda, when we believed her
to be above the average: she ought to go far."
</p>

<p>
"Never for a moment have I doubted it," his wife
answered.  "She has power!  Her smallness, her
silence, her strength&mdash;it is a wonderful combination.
Many a time I have thanked God for her."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy," said Harry reflectively, "that Mrs. Cooper
to this day believes that we shall repent, and that it
was Melicent who corrupted her entire household, girls,
maids, governess, all in the space of two or three
weeks."
</p>

<p>
"If she does, the vicar knows better," returned his
wife, "and is glad enough for Gwen and Theo to come
to us whenever they can."
</p>

<p>
"I believe we made one mistake," thoughtfully pursued
the man.  "I have often wished that I had not complied
with the vicar's written request that the Burmesters
should be told nothing.  I don't want them to think
there is anything to conceal, as far as Millie is concerned.
You see, Mayne doesn't like the circumstances of her
leaving Africa talked about, and Cooper doesn't like
the circumstances of her leaving the Vicarage talked
about.  At this rate, it seems to me that she may
become a Woman with a Past, if we don't take care."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pooh," said Brenda; "don't make a fuss about
nothing.  Everybody knows what the Coopers are."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, a gay voice, a dog's bark, a scuffle, was
heard without; and the girl they both loved whisked
in, waving a roll of vellum in her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Behold," said she, "the result of my labours!  A
certificate about the size of an ordinary table-cloth,
signed by about a dozen men whom nobody ever heard
of.  If that doesn't convince people of my competency
nothing ever will!"
</p>

<p>
She tossed the document in Brenda's lap, and sat
down on the fender-stool, a little out of breath.
</p>

<p>
She had not changed greatly since her early teens;
but she had improved.  She was still small, though
not too small; still pale, but with the clear, rose pallor
of a Malmaison carnation.  Her soft, fair hair was
becomingly arranged, her movements graceful, her
manner decidedly good.
</p>

<p>
"It's going to snow," cried she.  "March is going out
like a lion!  Pater, I hope the wind won't nip our crocuses."
</p>

<p>
"A Cleveshire crocus laughs at frost," said Helston.
"But will a Cleveshire maiden laugh at an impertinent
newspaper paragraph?"
</p>

<p>
"Paragraph!  You don't tell me!  Where?  After
all my trouble!"  She stopped short, indignant, her
cheeks suddenly rose-colour.  "Well, I don't care,"
she concluded defiantly.  "Ne'er a reporter of them
all shall flout me out of my humour."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I read it?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly!"
</p>

<p>
Helston did so, not without relish.  When he had
done, the girl made a sound of disdain.
</p>

<p>
"Charming!" she said.  "But what does it matter?
Does anybody whose opinion I value form that opinion
upon the <i>Hauberk</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will start doing what nobody has done
before,&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, somebody must start," said Melicent
composedly, "or nobody would ever get anywhere.  After
all, these things matter so little.  People very soon forget;
and one is not nearly so important as one believes."
</p>

<p>
"Your common-sense and self-possession are getting
quite odious, miss," said Brenda languidly.
</p>

<p>
Melicent was thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely it is true what they say&mdash;that a business
woman has got to sacrifice something.  But I always
was practical, you know."
</p>

<p>
"So little do we know ourselves," gasped Helston.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Am I not practical?"
</p>

<p>
"Dreamer, idealist, dweller in Utopia, believer in the
Fourth dimension and in the sum of the really important
things that nobody can classify&mdash;go to!" said he gravely.
"Tell that to the reporters, but not to the unfortunate
pater who had to hold you in when designing a house!
'Bridling the Tweed with a curb o' stane' would have
just been an interval for light refreshment."
</p>

<p>
Melicent, her arms about her knees, laughed blithely.
</p>

<p>
"For sheer power of vituperation, you are hard to
beat," she said.  "Well, mater, what have you been
doing all day?"
</p>

<p>
"When you have done railing at each other, you
shall hear.  I have news of a really exciting character,
but I shall not tell it until there is a suitable demand."
</p>

<p>
Melicent whirled round and clutched her.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?  Speak instantly!  Something
nice?  Something to take out the taste of that par.?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard news and received a visitor: who but
Lance Burmester?"
</p>

<p>
She had no reason to complain of lack of interest in
her hearers.  They rained questions upon her.
</p>

<p>
"He is in town for one night only," said she.  "Goes
down to Ilbersdale to-morrow; so I implored him to
come back and dine.  He demurred, on the ground
that he had two friends with him, whom he could not
desert One is a Captain Brooke, a friend picked up in
Africa.  The other is&mdash;guess, Melicent!"
</p>

<p>
There was a peculiar intonation in her voice.
</p>

<p>
Melicent looked up quickly, and met a mischievous
look; and suddenly colour flooded the girl's face.
Quite unexpectedly to herself, she did what she was
never wont to do&mdash;she blushed; and she felt as though
the blush covered her like a garment to the very feet.
</p>

<p>
The sensation made her furious.  Why should she
blush?  At the memory of a period of her life now
so incredibly remote that it seemed like a previous
incarnation?  She sometimes felt, in the infrequent
moments when she recalled her amatory experiences,
as though she had merely dreamed the savagery, the
bestiality, of her African days; as though she had first
awakened to life when her uncle drove her out upon
the high heathery Nab that overlooked the moorlands.
</p>

<p>
Brenda's hint evoked a rushing stream of unpleasant,
importunate memories.  Was it possible that Bert had
bridged the five years' silence?  That he was still in
pursuit&mdash;still claiming the promise made in a
half-delirious moment?
</p>

<p>
Her inmost being sickened.  It could not be!  Not
now, on the very threshold of her career&mdash;now that she
had grown used to happiness and love and England.
Disgust was so acute that she grew actually faint.
</p>

<p>
With a craving for air she sprang from her low seat
by the fire, stood up, drew a long breath, flung back
her head.  What useless panic!  She was free: no
promise could be said to bind her!  Why should she
fear?
</p>

<p>
The shock, the overwhelming spasm of apprehension,
passed away so quickly that the Helstons had barely
time to wonder what was amiss when she took calmly
on her lips the name that haunted her.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really mean that it is Bert Mestaer?"
</p>

<p>
Brenda laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Bert Mestaer!  What a notion!  You would hardly
expect Mr. Burmester to make friends with him!  Oh,
no; it is someone whom you will really like to
see&mdash;surely you can guess!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mayne?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!"
</p>

<p>
The relief, the reaction, were extraordinary.
Melicent's head swam.  With more demonstration of
feeling than was usual to her, she clapped her
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is good!  I am pleased!  What a pity he
did not get back in time for my twenty-first birthday
last spring!  I wonder whether he will think that I
have changed!"
</p>

<p>
"Your wonder will be speedily set at rest.  As it
appeared that Lance was inseparable from his friends,
and that this was his only night, I told him to bring
them both back to dinner at eight.  I sent Elizabeth
for fish and cream, and I wish you would go into the
dining-room on your way upstairs, and see that the
flowers on the table are all right."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" cried Melicent, and heaved a sigh.  "Things
are happening to-night in the bosom of this peaceful
family.  Pater, just put away that odious newspaper in
the table drawer, so that nobody can see it.  To think
of Mr. Mayne being in England!  Why didn't he write
and say he was coming?"
</p>

<p>
"I fancy he only quite suddenly found that he could
get away.  You see, all his plans are changed.  He is
to be Bishop of Pretoria."
</p>

<p>
"Bishop!  Oh, lucky Pretoria!"
</p>

<p>
Melicent paused again, her eyes full of memories.
She saw an open grave, a long black procession of
uncouth people winding down the rough fields, past the
Kaffir huts&mdash;the sun blazing down on Carol Mayne's
sharp-cut, ascetic face.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I am the Resurrection and the Life.  He that believeth
on Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The thought of what her heart had been then, torn
with hatred, racked with grief, savage, sullen, lonely,
arose in sharp contrast with the thought of all that had
been since, all that she had come to understand, believe
and hope, in these full years of growth that lay between.
</p>

<p>
Moved by a rare impulse, she stooped and tenderly
kissed Brenda's forehead, before going to inspect the
flowers upon the dinner-table.

CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
CAPTAIN BROOKE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "What man would risk the danger twice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor quake from head to heel?<br>
  Whom would not one such test suffice?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;A. C. SWINBURNE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Not Melicent herself looked forward to the moment of
meeting with more eagerness than did the Bishop elect
of Pretoria.  He had been through many anxieties
during his first months of guardianship; and his
gratitude to the Helstons was immense.  It was most
natural that he should look forward with interest to a
sight of the girl he had saved.
</p>

<p>
She was not present in the drawing-room when the
three men arrived, but the cordiality of the Helstons'
reception was delightful.  Lance was grateful to them
for including his friend, a big, silent man, who had
been with much difficulty persuaded to come.  Brenda
assured him that six was a far better number than five,
and made him welcome with sincerity which could not
fail to please.
</p>

<p>
"But he wouldn't have come at all; he would have
held out obstinately," said Lance gaily, "but for one
thing, one mysterious reason, which will transpire later.
You needn't blush, Brooke."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't the least intention of it; don't play the
fool, Burmester.  I suppose it was natural for an
outsider to feel that he was intruding on a party of
friends who were meeting after long separation."
</p>

<p>
"Just as well for you to become acquainted now, for
you'll be sure to meet at Fransdale," said Lance easily.
"I suppose you are going up for Easter, Mrs. Helston,
and I am taking Brooke and the Bishop to Ilbersdale."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, the door opened, and all three men
turned to watch Melicent as she came in.
</p>

<p>
She had rather more colour than usual, and her
expression was strangely arresting.  Her evening gown
was white, and trailed over the soft carpet with a
delicate rustling.  She walked straight up to Carol
Mayne, her eyes shining, her two hands outstretched:
and he caught them in his, meeting her glance with the
piercing, deep-set eyes she remembered so well of old.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" he cried.  "So this is you!  How thankful
I ought to be that my responsibilities are over!  Ah,
well, I don't think I should have known you, if I had
met you in the street, but I am beginning to recognise
the eyes, the brow!  The smile is new.  I never saw
that in Africa; did I, Miss Lutwyche?"
</p>

<p>
She looked up gravely, but with a certain kindled
enthusiasm, far more impressive than a girl's laughter.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Miss Lutwyche!</i>" she said reproachfully.  "I shall
not allow that.  As for you, you are not a bit changed.
I should know you anywhere&mdash;Bond Street, or darkest
Africa."
</p>

<p>
"What about me, Miss Lutwyche?" cried Lance pleadingly.
</p>

<p>
"You have improved," she said, with an air of critical
appraisement.  "You are not nearly so&mdash;lady-like as
you used to be."
</p>

<p>
They all laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Are you still a crack shot, as you used to be?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I shoot every autumn.  I have improved," she
replied demurely.
</p>

<p>
When Captain Brooke had been presented, they all
sat down, and the talk hung fire a little.
</p>

<p>
"It is too big," said Melicent, with a little sigh.
"There is so much to say, we don't know where to
begin.  Mr. Mayne, I know, is thinking of me with my
hair in a pig-tail, and a calico frock, slouching across
the yard with a copper bucket; and Mr. Burmester is
thinking of a time when I was locked up in disgrace
in the Vicarage schoolroom, and not allowed to go to a
picnic; and Captain Brooke is thinking how disagreeable
it is of people to have reminiscences he cannot share."
</p>

<p>
Captain Brooke smiled a little.
</p>

<p>
"I am thinking that it is hard to fancy you in a
calico dress with a copper bucket," he said.
</p>

<p>
Melicent was suddenly grave.
</p>

<p>
"People who have always lived in England don't
realise," she said absently.  "We dwell in a kind of
Garden of Eden here, and nobody appreciates it.  They
should go to some place such as I was brought up
in, and learn what thorns and briars lie outside the
garden gates."
</p>

<p>
"I saw a good deal of it during the campaign," the
soldier answered.  "A good deal of outer darkness, I
mean."
</p>

<p>
"Does England seem good after it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly what you say.  Like the Garden of Eden."
</p>

<p>
At the moment dinner was announced, and they
went into the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Melicent, who was seated next
Mr. Mayne, "that it is of no use to ask you after old
acquaintance?  It is so long since you left Slabbert's
Poort?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," he answered, "I have kept up with one or
two of the folks there.  But the general scatter, when
the war broke out, made great changes, though, as you
know, the place was never in the line of march.  Marten
Brandt still owns the Vierkleur."
</p>

<p>
"I often meant to ask you in my letters what became
of Otis?"
</p>

<p>
"The great Amurrica?  It is reported that he made
himself notorious in the Boer Irish brigade, but later
on&mdash;after the capture of Kroonstadt&mdash;he turned up on the
British side, got a commission in a scallywag corps,
how I know not, and is quite a great person now."
</p>

<p>
"Not sure he ain't a colonel; I knocked up against
the beast," said Lance.  "Remember hearing about
Gouverneur J. Otis, eh Brooke?  Remember the story
of Sal's Drift and the stampede of the gun mules?"
</p>

<p>
The two men laughed, as at a common memory.
</p>

<p>
"Worst of him was, the brute was so witty," said
Lance.  "I believe all our officers knew he was not to
be trusted, but they made no end of a fuss with him.
Daresay he'll be turning up in England soon, in some
swell house that's been lent as a convalescent home, and
flirt with all the titled girls as bold as you please."
</p>

<p>
"Let's see; he was the chap who got his head
punched by Millie's Boer champion, wasn't he?" asked
Mr. Helston.
</p>

<p>
His wife gave him a warning glance.  Young
Burmester was present, and he knew nothing of the
girl's vicissitudes, nor was it desirable that he should.
Besides, there was a stranger among them.  She could
see, by the way he instantly began to speak, that Mayne
was as desirous as she to turn the subject; but Lance
had caught the word.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Miss Lutwyche! had you begun breaking
heads and hearts, even before you came over?" he
asked gaily, across the table.
</p>

<p>
"Boers don't trouble about hearts," said the girl, with
composure.  "We were a pastoral people, and never did
anything interesting.  It is you from whom we expect
tales of prowess.  Did you never escape in a goods train,
or scale a prison wall, or&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As to that," said Lance, "I've a magnificent yarn,
all ready for telling, only this beggar"&mdash;indicating his
friend, who sat next to him and opposite Millie&mdash;"tried,
before he would come here to-night, to get me to promise
not to tell."
</p>

<p>
Melicent had wholly succeeded in turning away the
subject.  The silent captain reddened, looked morose,
and was heard to murmur that Burmester was a
rotter.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you were not so rash as to make the promise
in question?" cried Brenda.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do you know, as far as to-night goes, I'm afraid
I did!" owned Lance.
</p>

<p>
"You did," said Brooke distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"But the fact of it is," said Lance lightly, "that he
saved my life.  Ever heard it said that if you save a
man's life, he's sure to do you a bad turn?  Look out
for me, Brooke."
</p>

<p>
"I'll look out for myself," was the unamiable reply.
</p>

<p>
"But it's only if you save from drowning that the
proverb applies," said the host.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this was drowning.  River suddenly rose while
the column was crossing; and the last men got washed
away.  But this is spoiling my yarn.  I'll keep it for
when Brooke isn't about."
</p>

<p>
"I told you I should spoil sport if I came," said
Brooke grimly.
</p>

<p>
Melicent looked at him with some amusement
</p>

<p>
He was a fair man, severely tanned by exposure.  He
was clean-shaven, and the salient feature of his face was
his large, finely-cut, strong yet delicate mouth: a mouth
which lifted his otherwise rough-hewn face up to a
different level, and made it full of possibilities.  With
such a mouth a man might be a poet, a soldier, a
statesman; but whatever he was, that he would thoroughly
be.  He was also shy, to an extent that was amusing in
such a Hercules.  When he spoke, he muttered: and he
hardly ever raised his eyes.
</p>

<p>
The gentlemen did not linger over their wine.  Mayne
was anxious to talk to Melicent of her future, and
Lancelot was astonished at himself for the anxiety he
felt to return to the drawing-room.  He remembered
a day when he had seen a slip of a girl seated on Tod's
Trush, and how he had said to Helston: "One is
conscious of a personality."  He was vividly conscious of
it now.  It was the "indefinable something" that
Melicent possessed.  She never spoke much, but always
gave the fascinating impression of vast reserves behind,
of a boundless store from which she could give more,
and always more.
</p>

<p>
He was vexed with Mrs. Helston for engaging him at
some length in talk, which she did advisedly, to allow
Carol to talk to the girl.
</p>

<p>
It was with interest and satisfaction that Mayne
listened to her, and found out how soon she hoped to
be self-supporting, and how close were the ties that
bound her to her friends.  There seemed no cloud
upon her horizon; life, which had begun so stormily
seemed, like many a rainy English morn, to be breaking
out into a cloudless sky.
</p>

<p>
"But there is one thing I want to ask you about,"
said Melicent presently.  "I have one wrinkle among
my rose-leaves.  It is only a little thing, yet at times I
fear it I have a constant dread that ... you know
who ... may turn up.  I expect it is very silly of me.
Men soon forget these things; and in so long a time,
he is sure to have forgotten.  But I have wished to see
you, to make sure.  I didn't like to write about it.  I
can't help a dreadful kind of feeling rushing over me at
times, that he..." she looked round.  Nobody was in
hearing but Captain Brooke, idly turning over music on
the piano; she dropped her voice&mdash;"that Bert
Mestaer&mdash;may still think he has a claim on me."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence, which the chat of the group by
the fire did not seem to break.  Captain Brooke earnestly
studied the song he was reading.
</p>

<p>
"That idea&mdash;the idea that Mestaer might still think
of you&mdash;would not be pleasant to you?" asked Mayne.
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant?" the word was a gasp.  "But you see
the life that is mine now," she said tremulously.  "You
remember the house of bondage&mdash;the darkness and
shadow of death."
</p>

<p>
"Bert Mestaer wanted to loose your bonds."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  Only to bind me to another master!"
</p>

<p>
"I think you wrong him there, Melicent."
</p>

<p>
She turned towards him, put out one hand, and laid
it on his.
</p>

<p>
"It was you who saved me; you delivered my soul
from the snare of the hunter," she said.  "If Mestaer
let me go, you were the only man that could have
persuaded him.  You know it; we need not discuss it.
What I want you to tell me is, whether you have seen
or heard anything of him; whether he is alive or dead."
</p>

<p>
"He was certainly alive when I left Africa.  He did
splendidly during the war.  I believe he is considered
the finest scout in the British army.  I feel sure I may
take it upon myself to say, on his behalf, that he will
never make himself obnoxious to you.  You need be in
no fear of him."
</p>

<p>
"He has forgotten all that nonsense about me?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't exactly know what you mean by nonsense,
Millie.  If you mean his love for you, I don't think I
can truly say that he has forgotten."
</p>

<p>
She made a little sound of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"But he is in process of forgetting&mdash;he must be!"
she cried.  "Anyhow, he doesn't expect me to start off
to Africa to keep the promise he says I made?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing could be farther from his thoughts, I
assure you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is what I wanted to be sure of!  Now I
shall breathe freely again.  I will confess to you now,
that I had a terrible moment this evening.  Mater said
Mr. Burmester had come home, and laughed and asked
me to guess who was with him!  I leaped to the
conclusion that it was Bert Mestaer, and I suddenly
found myself in the grip of a blind terror.  I thought I
should faint, all the horror of that dreadful time came
back so clearly.  I don't think I could have faced
him...."
</p>

<p>
But Lance was no longer to be held back.  He broke
away from his captors, and came towards Millie, calling
for a song.  Captain Brooke, who still stood forlorn
and rigid by the piano, leaning his chin on his hand,
was roughly pushed away.  Melicent sat down without
shyness, and sang two or three ballads in a voice that&mdash;like
herself&mdash;was small and flexible and very distinctive.
The last thing she sang was that wonderful little piece
of inspiration,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The night has a thousand eyes."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Captain Brooke was turning over for her.
</p>

<p>
"That's very true," he said,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'The mind has a thousand eyes,<br>
  The heart but one,'"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he repeated thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered; "yet many people seem
content with the one!  I suppose all women used to
be!  Think what an awful fate, to look on life merely
as a matter of sentiment!  The thousand eyes are
better, don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"I never tried," he answered simply.
</p>

<p>
The reply struck her as remarkable, but she had no
time to reflect upon it, for Lance again struck in:
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me wonderful, with a profession of your
own, that you should find time to learn to sing so
beautifully," he said.
</p>

<p>
"The singing is my recreation," she replied, "the
other my serious work."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" cried Lance, "and that reminds me of old
Brooke's business and the reason why he came here
to-night!  Do you know, Miss Lutwyche, Brooke wants
to build a house, and he's been reading a paragraph in
the <i>Hauberk</i> about a lady architect."
</p>

<p>
Melicent grew pink, and looked down.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke won't want to give his work to such
a complete novice," she said demurely.  "Now that he
has seen me, he will want to retire gracefully from his
intention, and you put him in a cruel dilemma by
mentioning it."
</p>

<p>
"I like trying experiments," said the Captain, with
more animation than he had yet displayed.
</p>

<p>
Everyone was now crowding with interest around the
music-stool where Melicent sat.
</p>

<p>
"What and where would your house be, Captain
Brooke?" asked Helston.
</p>

<p>
"It would be in my&mdash;my&mdash;the place my people
come from," he replied.  "It's in Wiltshire."
</p>

<p>
"Wiltshire!  That's a variable county; on Salisbury
Plain?"
</p>

<p>
"No; it's a pretty village.  Clunbury, they call it."
</p>

<p>
"What kind of house do you think of building?"
</p>

<p>
"I should leave that entirely to Miss Lutwyche."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Melicent, here's your chance!" cried Helston
mischievously.  "You'll be able to send another
paragraph to the <i>Hauberk</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"How dare you?" she cried, threatening him in mock
rage.  "Oh ... but this is wonderful!  Are you serious,
Captain Brooke?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  I have bought the land.  Only about twenty
acres.  I should like your advice about the actual site of
the house."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Millie, if you give satisfaction over this, your
career is made," cried Brenda.
</p>

<p>
"But what kind of house do you want?" cried the
girl.  "You must tell me that!"
</p>

<p>
"No; that's what I shall pay you to tell me," said
Millie's client calmly.  He smiled for the first time, as
he added: "You have the thousand eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" said Melicent, "the agitations of this day
have been quite too much for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Do your people live at Clunbury?" asked Helston
of the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; not now.  They sold their last acre in my
grandfather's time.  A churchyard full of their graves
is all that is left.  It is, however, a part of their land
that I have bought back."
</p>

<p>
"That is the kind of thing I would like to do
myself," said Carol Mayne.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miss Lutwyche, is the house rising before your
mind's eye?" cried Lance, pleased at the intense
interest created by the scheme.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Melicent; but her eyes were dreamy.
"What kind of people were your forbears?" she asked
the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Merely yeomanry," he answered, "and wholly
Philistine; people with one eye."
</p>

<p>
"And do you want the house to resemble them in
tone?" she asked, smiling at his allusion.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I want it to be the typical house that is in your
mind; the house you would live in, if you could choose."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Take care!  You don't know how lordly my ideas
may be!  You will have to bring them down to the
level of estimates."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want the thing put in hand at once?"
asked Helston.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  I should like Miss Lutwyche to come
down and look at the site before I go to Ilbersdale for
Easter."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Millie, you must make up your mind!  Do
you accept the order?" cried Carol Mayne.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to come down and look at the site
before I finally say Yes," said she.  "And ask Captain
Brooke all manner of questions."
</p>

<p>
"That will suit me well," he replied gravely.
"To-day is Monday.  Shall we say Thursday?"

CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
MIRAGE
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "He who has seen a city in the skies<br>
  Knows he may never cool his tired eyes<br>
  At the fair waters of that Paradise.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  But the one moment when he thought his feet<br>
  Would enter that dream-city, was so sweet<br>
  That he can bear the noonday and its heat."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ALICE HERBERT.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The sky was clear and starry; the night was swept by
the strong, clean current of the March wind, as the three
men stepped out into Collis Square.
</p>

<p>
"How shall we get back?" asked Burmester, lighting
his cigar.  "Train, tube or bus?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall walk," said Brooke, with brevity.
</p>

<p>
They were standing just beneath a street lamp, whose
strong light, falling on his face, showed it haggard and
strained.  Burmester did not observe it.
</p>

<p>
"You don't catch me!" he cried jovially, flinging
away his light.  "Come on, Bishop&mdash;leave that maniac
to his own devices.  Here's a hansom, the very thing."
</p>

<p>
The jingling cab pulled up at his signal, and he sprang
in.  "Rhodes Hotel!"
</p>

<p>
"All right, Burmester, I'm walking a bit with Brooke,"
said Mayne.
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you are!  Nice trick to play on me!"
cried Lance, as he was bowled away.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you go with him, and leave me to myself?"
growled Brooke, lighting a pipe with a hand that shook.
</p>

<p>
"Because I want your society, though it seems the
desire is not mutual."
</p>

<p>
There was no reply.  They tramped eastwards in
silence, past the Marble Arch, down Park Lane into
Grosvenor Square, and on into Berkeley Square, where
suddenly Brooke said:
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would go."
</p>

<p>
"You're not playing fair," quietly replied Mayne.
"Conspirators ought to share confidences."
</p>

<p>
"Confide away then."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I will.  I am as pleased as I feel sure you
must be, though you don't show it, at the result of your
idea."
</p>

<p>
"Pleased!" echoed Brooke.  "Pleased! ... Great
Heaven!  Pleased, are you?  But then, you see, I am
not you.  Bishop, I know every line of her face, every
tone of her voice, though I never heard but one in the
old days!  I know her as a man knows the land where
he was born; and she could sit looking full at me
across the table, and not know she had ever seen
me! ... Man!  How have I come through it?"
</p>

<p>
"Excellently.  I don't understand you.  Surely it is
what you were hoping for, planning for&mdash;complete
non-recognition?  What would have happened if she had
known you?  You heard what she said to me about you?"
</p>

<p>
"Every word;" his voice sank to a despairing whisper.
</p>

<p>
"She is at least consistent," said Mayne.
</p>

<p>
An inarticulate murmur of assent.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think the non-recognition wonderful," went
on Mayne.  "You see, she never thought about you, or
even looked at you attentively in old days.  And think
what you were like then!  Not only the outer man has
changed.  Remember that I myself, when first I saw
you without your beard, and without your slouch, and
without your oaths&mdash;in your uniform, drilled into a
self-respecting Englishman&mdash;I did not know you."
</p>

<p>
"But you did, as soon as I said: 'Don't you remember me?'"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly; because you did say so.  But you have
not said so to Miss Lutwyche; and don't you see that
your very failure to do so would banish the idea of your
possible identity from her mind?  You come before her
with looks, words, manners, your very nationality&mdash;all
changed!  An English landed proprietor!  Doubtless
she knows nothing of the great diamond find on the
High Farm, nor of the fortune you have realised.  The
idea that you should adopt such a method of gaining
access to her, would never strike her, it would not seem
characteristic of her preconceived idea of you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how I got through," said the Captain
brokenly.  "When she came in, looking like an angel
from God ... and passed me by and went up to you!
By George, Mayne, she was right!  It was you who
saved her!  But for you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She was wrong; it was you," said Mayne.  "She
will probably never know the fight you made; women
don't understand these things, and it is as well they
don't.  Things go like that in the world."
</p>

<p>
"She's beautiful, Mayne; don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
Mayne laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think her at all angelic," he replied, "but I
will own that she seems to me less unlovable than I
used to think her in Africa.  Don't punch my
head! ... Burmester admired her, I thought."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, confound him!"
</p>

<p>
"But you have made a splendid opening.  The idea
of the house was a masterly one.  It gives you endless
opportunities and a common interest.  Only remember,
you must keep yourself well in hand.  As I warned
you, the game is a dangerous one.  One false move
may cost you all."
</p>

<p>
"The worst is over now," returned the Captain.
"The awfulness of feeling that she's everything to
me, I a nightmare to her!  I can still hardly believe
she didn't know me."
</p>

<p>
"Everything was in your favour.  She was full of
my return, and of relief that it was I, not you.  The
silent Captain Brooke was a negligible quantity."
</p>

<p>
"She never looked at me squarely but once.  That
was in the middle of dinner.  My heart nearly stopped.
I had to lower my eyes lest they should say things.
Ah, well; you're a good sort, and no mistake.  I'm glad
we've talked it out, though I was a sulky brute at first."
</p>

<p>
"H'm!  Yes; Melicent might think the change in
you not so deep if she had heard your way with me
this evening," said his friend drily.  "The old Bert is
still there, in spite of all the polish."
</p>

<p>
Bert laughed as he strode on, with his long, swinging
step.  He made a fine tribute to the creative powers
of Sergeant What's-his-name.  There had been good
material to work upon, and the right kind of training;
and the result was something like a miracle.
</p>

<p>
In the old days, Mayne had realised that this man
was something out of the common: but even he had
not been prepared for his persistence, nor for his
wonderful <i>flair</i> for knowing the right men, reading the
right books, doing the right thing.  During all these
five years, no week had passed without the exchange
of letters between those two.  Mayne had sent up
books, had cheered and inspired his pupil, had never
let him feel that nobody cared.  Bert had bent all the
powers of his strong mind and still stronger will
towards the attainment of his one idea.  His life had
been a life of monastic purity, of iron self-control, of
self-denial and constant effort.  It was hard for the
priest to believe that such a wonderful thing could
fail of its reward.  But he had been troubled at what
Melicent said that evening.  He almost made up his
mind that he would tell her something of what her
influence had meant to Bert.  But his final decision
was for complete inaction in this most delicate matter.
Bert must fight his own battle, and win his own victory.
The time had come for his friend to stand aside.
</p>

<p>
Far into the night Mayne was considering the case.
He, with his unusual insight into souls, had found a
certain egotism and hardness in Melicent.  The hardness
was inherent&mdash;it had always been there; and her
present life of independence and success was likely to
foster it.  Did she know, at that moment, that a man
was in London who had spent five laborious years in
fitting himself for her conquest, as a nation may equip
itself for a great campaign&mdash;and who was bent solely
upon that quest&mdash;he felt pretty certain that her only
impulse would be to escape from him, to guard her
own freedom, to determine resolutely never to be
enslaved.
</p>

<p>
Would the constancy and persistence of the man be
a match for the hardness and self-will of the woman?
</p>

<p>
He thought Bert might stand a better chance of
winning, were it not for the bitter memories which
were bound up in the girl's mind with him.  That
she should long remain in ignorance of his identity was
inconceivable: and when she recognised him&mdash;what
then?
</p>

<p>
Bert was his own spiritual son; his desire for his
success was intense.  But now that he had seen
Melicent, he was full of doubts.  Carefully as Bert
had educated himself, the gulf between them was
still wide.
</p>

<p>
He could do nothing but pray.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
RECOGNITION
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Go from me.  Yet I feel that I shall stand<br>
  Henceforward in thy shadow.  Nevermore<br>
  Alone upon the threshold of my door<br>
  Of individual life, I shall command<br>
  The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand<br>
  Serenely in the sunshine as before."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It had been arranged that the fledgling architect should
be accompanied by Mr. Helston, and have the benefit
of his knowledge and experience when she went down
to look at Captain Brooke's estate at Clunbury.  But
fate decreed otherwise.  On Thursday morning
Mr. Helston was in bed with a high temperature and sore
throat.  A railway journey on a raw, gusty day in early
spring was out of the question for him; and Melicent
was obliged to go alone.
</p>

<p>
Brenda suggested something about her being
unchaperoned, which was met by the young lady with
unspeakable scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Better throw up my profession at once, if
Mrs. Grundy is to have a say in my business arrangements,"
she remarked; and caught her train at Paddington with
professional composure.
</p>

<p>
She alighted at a small station on a branch line, which
was the nearest point to the village; and as she stepped
from the compartment, Captain Brooke approached, in
a suit of country tweeds, gaiters and knickerbockers.  In
such guise he reminded her of her beloved Dalesmen,
and the idea gave kindness to her smile of greeting.
</p>

<p>
As he approached, she noted that he looked pale
under his tan, and seemed not perfectly ready to speak
at once.
</p>

<p>
"So Mr. Helston was unable," he brought out, after
manifest hesitation.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked surprised.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry!  He is in bed with a severe chill.  I
bring you his apologies.  But if you think he is
indispensable&mdash;" she added, as an afterthought, puzzled by
the disturbance visible in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! by no means.  It is good of you to come alone,"
he said hurriedly.  "This way, please; I have only a
hired trap at present, and am putting up at the inn
near here, which is two miles from the village.  I've
ordered lunch, but it won't be much good, I'm afraid;
these English country inns are astonishingly bad."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't apologise," she said.  "I am used to
roughing it, and I like it."
</p>

<p>
He smiled, as he tucked her into the dog-cart, and
remarked, as he climbed to his seat beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Collis Square didn't seem very rough to me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  But you haven't seen me at work.  I can lay
bricks, mix mortar, point walls&mdash;it's delicious."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "I feel sure you could do anything you
tried," he said.
</p>

<p>
They drove on briskly, through a lane whose hedges
were beginning to show bronze buds upon their blackness.
The sky, after some boisterous sleet storms, was
washed a clear, pure blue.  A faint golden haze of
willow catkins brooded over the adjacent brown copses,
and the wet sparkles on the bare boughs threw back the
sunbeams.  Here and there the lazy reek from a cottage
chimney hung pearly against the indigo fir woods&mdash;a
typical English April, and a typical English landscape.
</p>

<p>
"Do you like this country?" he asked abruptly, and
his tone seemed to imply that he thought anybody must.
</p>

<p>
She made a conventional answer that it was very pretty.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you don't care for scenery?" he inquired
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
She turned to him laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, "scenery is my particular fad.  But
this is too tame for me.  You should see my Cleveshire
moors and dales!"
</p>

<p>
His silence, in some inscrutable way, conveyed to her
the idea of extreme mortification.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean," he presently asked, "that you
wouldn't care to live in this part of England?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't choose it," she replied carelessly.  "But
then, I have no links with it.  I quite appreciate your
reason for choosing it."
</p>

<p>
"You do?"
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly.  Your ancestry drew their living
from this soil; they ate the corn it grew, the cattle
it fed.  In a real sense, you are part of this little bit
of little England.  There must be something in you
that is in mysterious sympathy with it."
</p>

<p>
"That's how I feel," he replied, as though gratified to
be so interpreted by her.  "But I admire the country
for itself too; it seems a great pleasure-ground&mdash;a sort
of park laid out by God Almighty."
</p>

<p>
"I like more mystery, more wildness."
</p>

<p>
"I've had enough wildness," he answered very
determinedly.  "I like this because of its cultivation
and fertility and order."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to show you Fransdale," she said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will," he replied.  "I'm going to Ilbersdale,
you know."  He reflected for some minutes, then
said: "Should you advise me not to decide on this till
I've seen the other?"
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Millie, "when you've bought your
land, and found your ancestors and all!  I never heard
of such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"I might put up a shooting-box on the moors," he
said reflectively.
</p>

<p>
"You must be very rich," commented the girl, in
wonder.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I am.  I did a big deal in land out there,"
he replied.
</p>

<p>
Privately she thought he had more money than wits;
but perhaps he would make none the worse client for
that.
</p>

<p>
They reached the inn, and he ushered her into the
quaint, low parlour, with the usual stuffed birds, coloured
almanacks and corner cupboard.
</p>

<p>
During the interval before the appearance of the roast
fowl and boiled ham, she unrolled the drawings she had
brought, spread them on a table in the window, and
described them to him.  The sun streamed in at the
lattice, gilding her hair where it curled over and about
the edges of her wide, flat, dark-blue cap as she sat
absorbed in her plans and ideas.  Her companion
drank in the details of her dainty presence&mdash;from her
fine skin to her firm, little hands, from her natty,
embroidered collar to the strong, laced boots appearing
below her short blue serge skirt.  He was considering
whether he found her more adorable in the lamplight in
her white gown, or in the sunshine, in her workmanlike,
country suit Suddenly he was conscious that he had
failed to answer a question, and that a severe, surprised
little face was being lifted to his.
</p>

<p>
Their glances met; he had a moment's awful
apprehension.  It seemed to him that she had caught him
unawares without his mask.  He had no notion what
was the question she had asked, and he floundered
desperately.
</p>

<p>
"You were saying&mdash;I am such a thundering ass&mdash;my
mind had gone off.  I was thinking that you can
see the Lone Ash, where I want to build&mdash;from this
window&mdash;there.  That hill to the left&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The inn maid-servant, bringing in the lunch, saved
him.
</p>

<p>
But his moment of confusion, so much greater than
the occasion seemed to warrant, had jarred the smooth,
impersonal nature of Miss Lutwyche's opinion of him.
There had been so remarkable a look&mdash;almost of
consternation&mdash;in the man's eyes as he faced her.  She
had been at some pains to expound the main principle
of the Lee-Simmons system of drainage for isolated
houses, which was her special fancy, and which she
was most anxious to have him adopt; and it was
certainly annoying to find that she had been speaking
to deaf ears.  But his curious expression when she had
looked at him!  He had seemed like one suddenly
caught in the act&mdash;taken red-handed.  What could
the thought be which had absorbed his attention, and
reddened his brown cheek?
</p>

<p>
She was so kind as to repeat her information while
they sat at lunch together, and had no cause this
time to complain of lack of attention.  But his
momentary lapse had occasioned in her a subtle
change of mental attitude.  She was, without knowing
why, suddenly on her guard&mdash;all at once concerned with
this man, about whom before she had not thought at all.
</p>

<p>
Of course she did not say this to herself.  Like all
deep-seated motions of the mind, it was spontaneous,
unrealised.  But it was there; and the man encountered
it, felt it with his alarming sensitiveness where she was
concerned; and by degrees there arose up within him a
profound uneasiness, which made the simplest sentence
an effort.
</p>

<p>
Melicent soon settled, in her positive way, what was
wrong.  She thought the Captain, being rich and
eligible, was nervous of being <i>tête-à-tête</i> with his
youthful lady architect.  She spoke with elaborate ease
and unconcern, determined to show him there was
nothing to fear; but he seemed each moment more
self-conscious.
</p>

<p>
There was, nevertheless, no doubt that he was
interested&mdash;not only in the speaker, but in what she was
saying.  By the time lunch was over, he had practically
decided upon the Lee-Simmons idea, and was eager to
transport his architect to the scene of her enterprise at
once.  He went outside to the little rough plot of green
before the inn to find the ostler; and urged by an
impulse of such curiosity as she seldom felt, Melicent
went to the window to watch him.
</p>

<p>
A few village children were at play upon the green;
and one little girl, probably inspired by parents who
hoped for some advantage from the rich man who was
going to make his home among them, shyly approached
him as he stood.
</p>

<p>
He had put his hands behind him, and forgotten
himself in staring at the hill crowned by the Lone Ash,
where he meant his fairy palace to arise.  The little fair
girl advanced diffidently, shyly holding out a big round
bouquet of primroses, tightly tied together.  He turned,
looking down at her, half-amused; and Melicent thought
that the big, fine man and the blushing child with her
flowers, illumined by the crude spring sunshine, looked
like the coloured supplement to a Christmas Number.
</p>

<p>
The Captain accepted the flowers, felt in his pocket
for a penny, and turned back towards the inn door, with
the intention of presenting the floral tribute to Miss
Lutwyche.
</p>

<p>
Now, what was there in that action&mdash;what sudden
thrill of memory&mdash;of recognition&mdash;of pain, like a sharp
blow on a raw spot&mdash;darted to the brain of the girl who
watched in the window?
</p>

<p>
She had seen a man come into a room once, with a
bunch of flowers in his awkward, unaccustomed hand;
she had heard the slapping thud with which they had
been hurled into the grate.
</p>

<p>
"<i>So you'll break your word!</i>"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her that the words were spoken aloud,
now, at this moment, in the room.  And a blinding
light illuminated her.  She knew, as completely as a
moment before she had ignored, that Captain Brooke
was none other than Bert Mestaer.
</p>

<p>
Waves of cold and heat, sudden dizziness clutched
her.  He was coming in&mdash;in a moment he would be
there&mdash;she could not face him.
</p>

<p>
Terror prevented unconsciousness.  Catching at the
furniture, she staggered across the room to the inner
room leading to the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
"Take me upstairs&mdash;a bedroom&mdash;I must lie down!"
she gasped; and as the maid-servant, scared by her
white face, rushed forward and encircled her with a
strong arm, she gasped: "Don't say anything to
Captain Brooke ... please.  I shall be ... better
directly."
</p>

<p>
The girl half supported, half dragged her up the
narrow stair.
</p>

<p>
"Dear miss, what shall I do?  Burnt feathers?  Key
down your back?" cried she distractedly.
</p>

<p>
"Is there&mdash;cold water?  Yes, that's all.  Go away
please.  Go!  Come back in ten minutes.  Leave me
alone now."
</p>

<p>
Melicent turned the key in the door, and sank upon
the scanty feathers of the rocky bed.  For several
minutes her one overpowering, paralysing sensation
was fear.  She could not think at all.
</p>

<p>
She lay prone, while the surging currents of her nerves
slowly settled themselves and adjusted their balance.
Her sense of outward things came back to her by
degrees.  The fine cold air flowed through the little
casement with the sunshine.  Wheels crunched upon
the gravel below; a dog barked; someone spoke; in the
distance a cow lowed.  The world went on as usual,
lapt in afternoon, rural peace.  But from her skies the
sun had dropped.  The nightmare that had pursued her
for years was now beside her in bodily shape, dogging
her steps.  Mestaer had come back.
</p>

<p>
How came it that she had not known?  She answered
herself bitterly that it was because she had trusted
Carol Mayne, and he had allowed her to be deceived.
Not for one moment did she now doubt Captain Brooke's
identity.  The marvel was that she had not detected
him at once.
</p>

<p>
This had been the first time of her looking at him, he
being unconscious of the fact of her observation; and in
that moment he had betrayed himself, she could not
have told how.
</p>

<p>
And now in what a net was she caught!  The
thought of the man's persistency turned her cold.  She
was committed to his acquaintance, involved in a
business transaction with him&mdash;he was going to
Ilbersdale.  Even in Fransdale she should not be safe
from him!  And Carol Mayne had connived at this
betrayal!
</p>

<p>
It did not take her long to form a decision on one
point; namely, that her only hope lay in going on as if
nothing had happened.
</p>

<p>
Surely she was capable of that!  She, the
self-contained, self-reliant professional woman!
</p>

<p>
Reaction had set in.  Passionate anger, active defiance
succeeded fear.  It was quite simple, after all.  She
had stolen a march upon the conspirators and surprised
their plans.  It was the best thing that could have
happened.  She knew now what to guard against&mdash;could
avoid intimacy and repel advances.
</p>

<p>
Springing from the bed, she dashed water into the
basin, bathed her hot forehead, and was once more her
own mistress, all her spirit, all her force, summoned up
to defend her liberty.
</p>

<p>
She peeped from the window.  Captain Brooke stood
waiting by the trap below.  His attitude betrayed a
subdued impatience.  Undoubtedly he was much
changed&mdash;completely altered from the man she had
known.  There was real excuse for her non-recognition.
But that he should have imagined that such an incognito
could be sustained!  No wonder he had betrayed
nervousness that morning when he faced the idea of
a day alone with her!
</p>

<p>
Well, they were equals now!  He knew, and she
knew.  If she could prevent his knowing that she knew,
all would be well.
</p>

<p>
She snatched up her gloves, and ran lightly downstairs,
not allowing herself time to pause, but passing
straight out into the sunshine to meet him.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;MRS. MEYNELL.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I've kept you waiting," she said a little
breathlessly, as she sprang into the cart.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's nothing, to a fellow who is always
waiting," was his calm reply.
</p>

<p>
"Always waiting!  What for?" cried Melicent,
wonder overleaping discretion.
</p>

<p>
"For the future, I suppose," he answered, after a
short hesitation.  Adding, as though suddenly conscious
of being eccentric: "You know&mdash;that endless chivying
of De Wet got on one's nerves."
</p>

<p>
"I can quite believe it," said Melicent cheerfully.
"But now, to-morrow has come, as I used to say when
I was a small child.  You've made your pile&mdash;you're
an English landed proprietor.  You're not waiting any
longer."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I am.  There's one thing I haven't got yet,"
he said, a slow, curious smile curving his fine mouth.
</p>

<p>
He did not look at her as he spoke, which fact was
her salvation.  She could rule her voice, but not the
rebel blood that waved live banners in her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Obviously," she returned lightly, "there must be a
mistress for Lone Ash when it is built.  Is this what
you're waiting for?"
</p>

<p>
Her own daring dazzled her.  It was a thing that he
could not possibly conceive her saying had she had any
notion of who he was.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered quietly, "that's what I'm waiting
for."
</p>

<p>
"And that's just what you'll never get by waiting!"
she cried gaily.
</p>

<p>
He turned sharply upon her.  "How do you know?
What do you mean?" he asked, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"If you want a wife, you must go in search of one,"
she answered mischievously.  "They don't drop into
people's mouths."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's what I will do," was his tranquil
answer; "but one thing at a time, you know."
</p>

<p>
"One thing at a time," she echoed, lightly; and as
she spoke, he checked his horse at the gate of a field.
</p>

<p>
"Here begins my property," he said, "and my idea
is to have the drive entrance-gate here, and the house
over yonder, just below the brow, screened from the
road by those trees.  The ground falls away to the
south and west, you will notice, but the Lone Ash hill
would keep off the wind.  I want to know what you
would think."
</p>

<p>
He had alighted, opened the gate, and led the horse
and cart through.  Now he proceeded, striding over
the grass, and Melicent, her arms round her knees,
forgot nervousness and bravado alike in her professional
enthusiasm.  They passed a large cluster of barns.
</p>

<p>
"The house was here," he said.  "The man who
bought it found it too far gone to repair, and knocked
it down, leaving the outer shell for barn walls.  Not
much of a place, you see.  I don't know why they put
it here, except for the well.  But there shouldn't be any
difficulty about getting water.  I sank a shaft up
yonder, where I am going to show you, and we struck
good water at thirty feet."
</p>

<p>
She found herself chatting to him about subsoils and
surface water in a wholly professional manner.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the place where he proposed to
build, she found herself unable to suggest an
improvement.  It was an ideal site&mdash;near the village, yet
secluded, sheltered, but not shut in&mdash;overlooking a bit
of broken ground which gave quite a prospect; and a
regular trap for sunbeams.  There was little she could
suggest by way of alteration; she grasped the main
features of his thought with instant appreciation.  They
sat down side by side upon the trunk of a felled elm;
she brought out her sketch-book, and drew suggestions.
By degrees a house shaped itself to her mind's eye&mdash;a
house full of pleasant detail.
</p>

<p>
The south front was to face a terrace; the drawing-room
to be at the western end, with two sunset avenues,
converging upon the large door-window.  One was to
focus the dying sun in winter, one in summer.  Both
were to be grass walks, cypress-bordered, and they were
to lead to a rectangular fish-pond, set with lilies, and
reached by shelving steps.  Beyond the fish-pond, a
warm brick wall, with deeply alcoved seats.
</p>

<p>
The cypress-edged grass walks were her special fancy.
</p>

<p>
"But don't have them unless you like," she earnestly
advised.  "Some people think them sad."
</p>

<p>
He would have had hop-poles at her recommendation,
but he managed to appear genuinely convinced.
</p>

<p>
Then, in fancy, his architect wandered back to the
house&mdash;to the hall, with its two-branched staircase, and
the windows in the gallery above.
</p>

<p>
"This house will be plain grey stone," she said, "and
its roof will be of tiles, to prevent the effect being too
cold.  We shall try to pick up tiles that are already
weathered, so that it may not look too new.  I will not
introduce anything that is a deliberate imitation of
what was old, such as timbering, barge-boards, or
painted woodwork.  You shall have no grotesques;
you must not yearn for a letter-box shaped like the
Ace of Spades, as they have in Hampstead, nor for
garrets with the window set at the end of a tunnel,
as one sees in all the new toy suburbs.  Our gables
will be few; our roof shall not be cut to pieces.  All
our lines shall be simple, and our chimney-stacks
things of beauty."
</p>

<p>
Her face was rapt as she sat looking at the bare
ground where in fancy she saw her creation taking
shape.  Captain Brooke, sitting at her side, let himself
go for a brief moment, gazing his fill upon the face that
was always graven on his heart.  It did not take her
long to become conscious of the scrutiny of his steady
eyes.  The moment that he saw she had come out of
her dream, he rose, and walked away to the excavations
his workmen had made, returning with lumps of marl
and chalky soil in his hands, and quietly making a
remark about foundations.
</p>

<p>
As they plunged into the discussion of builders,
estimates, contracts, etc., she realised that she was
full of reluctant admiration for him.  How well he
bore himself!  How completely he was master of his
feelings!  She felt, she knew, that he was entirely
to be trusted.  His speech was correct, his bearing
dignified; nobody would now take him for anything
but an English gentleman.  Five years had wrought
all this in him.  How persistently he must have striven;
how hard he must have worked!
</p>

<p>
And all this, she must conclude, had been done for
her&mdash;for one whose heart was wholly untouched by any
answering feeling&mdash;to whom the mere thought of him
was pain and humiliation&mdash;who asked nothing better
than never to see him again.
</p>

<p>
As the thought of her present position flooded her
again, she felt so strong an impulse of resentment that
for a long moment she was inclined to throw down her
plans, rise and denounce him&mdash;repudiate his claims,
break the chain that seemed to hold her, leave him
where he stood, and flee from him for ever.  How could
she go on like this, now that she knew?  Did not every
moment that passed leave her more deeply committed
to the incredible situation?
</p>

<p>
Never did she remember before to have been the
victim of indecision.  Now she, the self-poised,
self-sufficient Miss Lutwyche, was swayed to and fro like
a reed in the grip of opposing passions.  Terror drew
her one way, pride and ambition another.  Under all,
the mainspring of all, though she knew it not, the
desire to defy Bert, to pay him back in his own coin,
to seize his masquerade and turn it into a weapon for
her own use, to punish him withal.
</p>

<p>
And all the while the rollicking April wind sang in
the tree-tops, the sun moved westward, the light grew
mellow, till the lump of earth in the captain's hand
gleamed like a lump of gold.  And his architect walked
to and fro beside him; paused here, moved on again
upon a new impulse; measured out the dimensions of
things with her long builder's tape, and caused the
owner to stick little white bits of wood, marked with
weird symbols, into the ground at certain intervals.  So
they stood and talked, each ignorant of the storms
that swept the other.
</p>

<p>
The surface of the girl's manner&mdash;easy, impersonal,
remote&mdash;was never once impressed by the tremendous
undercurrent that lay below the man's cool utterances.
She was thinking: "After all, this is quite easy.  I
could keep it up for ever."
</p>

<p>
He was telling himself&mdash;"This sort of thing can't go
on.  Could I bear another day like this?"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, it was over.  She looked at her watch
and announced that she must catch the 5.10.  For a
moment the thought that the strain he had been feeling
so acutely was to be forthwith relaxed, gave him so
sharp a sense of loss that he could not immediately
speak.  When he did, it was to beg her to come back
first to tea at the inn.  She firmly declined this.  The
inn, to her, was horror-haunted.  The ghost of her past
had risen there to dog the footsteps which she had
believed were free.  She replied that she would have an
hour at the junction in which to get tea, and must not
stop now.
</p>

<p>
They returned to the dog-cart, and drove back, in
so brooding a silence on his part, that she dashed into
small talk, lest he should be contemplating some rash
words.  As they drove past the inn, she averted her
eyes that she might not see the green, or recall what
had stood there.  The vision of poor Bert, with his
bashful, uncertain smile, his ridiculous flowers, his
hesitating advance, rose before her, creating sheer
nausea.  Once more she was lying in the parlour at
High Farm, once more she felt the agony of her
wounds, the scars of which must to this day be hidden
from her dressmaker.  The crimson of shame suffused
her.  Oh, if he could but have kept away!  Usually
she managed to forget all this&mdash;to forget that she was
branded, physically and morally, by the searing flames
of degradation.  He was the living reminder of all she
hated and rejected.
</p>

<p>
She fell silent, unable to continue her babble; and
Bert was silent too.  But as they neared the railway,
and he found moments running short, he made a
spasmodic effort at conversation.
</p>

<p>
"You were brought up in Africa, were you not?" he
asked, as casually as he could.  He might as well have
held a match to gunpowder.
</p>

<p>
She turned upon him with a deadly quietude.
</p>

<p>
"Never speak to me of it," she said, almost between
her teeth.  "I have forgotten it all.  Every memory,
of place or people, revolts me.  There is nothing that
ever happened there, and nobody I ever knew there,
except Mr. Mayne, that inspires me with any feeling
but horror."
</p>

<p>
They were turning into the station yard.  He made
no reply to her words until he had brought the pony to
a standstill; then, turning fully to her, he said, very
simply:
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon."
</p>

<p>
Something in his dignity shamed her.  He helped
her down in silence, collected her odds and ends, felt
under the seat, and brought out the fatal bunch of
primroses, which he carried to the platform.
</p>

<p>
As they stood waiting, she said, hurriedly and
nervously:
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, Captain Brooke.  I didn't mean to
speak so horridly about Africa.  I hope I didn't hurt
your feelings."
</p>

<p>
"My mistake," he returned good-humouredly.  "We're
such slight acquaintances, I expect it was pretty cool
cheek of me to ask you a personal question.  I'm afraid
there are a good many holes in my manners."
</p>

<p>
No man could have shouldered the blame more
naturally.  The train came in.  He found her a
carriage, and handed in her things to her; then shyly
offered the flowers.
</p>

<p>
"A little village kid gave me these," he said; and she
thought, as he spoke, how fine a head and shoulders he
had, framed in the square of the open window.  "I
thought you might like to take them to town with you."
</p>

<p>
She just managed to say, with a vague smile, "Thank
you."  Then the train started, he had raised his hat,
stepped back, and she was in solitude.  For full five
minutes she sat motionless, crouched together, her two
hands gripping the seat, her eyes fixed on the
unoffending primroses, whose delicate, mysterious
fragrance stole towards her on the evening air.
</p>

<p>
At last, with a strangled cry, she sprang to her feet,
seized them, hurled them with all her force through the
window; and then, sinking back into her corner, burst
into wild, ungovernable tears.

CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
UNREST
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Let me alone!  Why must you claim me?  I<br>
  Am woman&mdash;do you tell me I must lie<br>
  All passive in Fate's arms until I die?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  I must not care for Art, nor crave to be<br>
  A force in this fair world&mdash;'tis not for me<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Carol Mayne passed all that day in a state of
feverish anxiety.  In the evening he suggested to
Lance that they should go round to Collis Square.  It
was late, but it was their only chance to call upon
Mrs. Helston before leaving town.  They arrived about
half-past eight, and found Brenda in the drawing-room,
and with her Theo Cooper, who was a frequent visitor.
</p>

<p>
It was now twelve months since this young lady had
defied parental authority and gone on the stage.
</p>

<p>
She was conspicuously unfitted for such a life, being
pretty in a showy way, forward and giddy.  But her
parents' very natural opposition did not weigh at all
with her.  They had so often objected to what was
wholesome, reasonable, and harmless, that their opinion
had no weight with any of their children.  With their
habitual reserve, they suppressed entirely their deeper
reasons for objection, and the only one they ostensibly
urged was: "What will people say?"  To a girl whose
one hope was to be notorious, this was no deterrent.
</p>

<p>
The affair of Gwendolen and young Freshfield had
produced a curious effect in the Vicarage family.  The
strenuous efforts of Mr. and Mrs. Cooper to hush it up
had been successful as regards their neighbours; but
this success had been dearly purchased at home at
the cost of lowering their children's estimate of them.
These merciless critics had now discovered that
whatever they did would be condoned, sooner than let the
world suspect a family breach, or a family scandal.
Mrs. Cooper's own theory of her perfection, and of her
success as a wife, mother, and leader of conduct in the
village, must be preserved at any sacrifice of truth.
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen and Madeline were despatched to school,
the governess was dismissed, and all went on as usual.
But from that moment each child took his or her own
line.
</p>

<p>
George, the eldest, whose sulky protest against taking
orders had been wholly ignored by his father, ran into
debt at Oxford, failed to take his degree, and finally
bolted to America, whence he wrote for funds at frequent
intervals.
</p>

<p>
Willie, the next boy, who had some ability, after
various letters and conversations which left the vicar
enraged, humiliated, well-nigh heart-broken, had gone
to reside with an agnostic community in East London.
He was just the man they wanted&mdash;his intellect exactly
of the calibre which quickly assimilates specious
argument, and reproduces it in an attractive form; and the
Fraternity of Man paid him one hundred pounds per
annum to teach men brotherhood, while denying
meanwhile the one great antecedent fact of common
Fatherhood.
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen, on leaving school, found herself unable
to live at home, and had gone to teach English in a
Russian family at St. Petersburg.  Madeline remained
at the Vicarage, nominally as governess to Barbara and
Beatrice; she was the weakest of the five, and the most
deeply influenced by her mother.
</p>

<p>
Theo would have been a very pretty girl, with a little
good taste to guide her.  But, coming up from the
lonely spot where her life had been spent, she, with
quick receptive capacity, imbibed notions of dress and
<i>coiffure</i> from the girls in the omnibuses in which she
travelled.  She wore, as Melicent once remarked, a
quantity of cheap clothes, extravagantly put on.
</p>

<p>
A bright-coloured silk blouse, low in the neck, beads,
artificial flowers, a becoming hat, but too large&mdash;atrocious
boots and a reek of scent&mdash;these must have convinced
anybody of the good ground Theo's parents had for
thinking her unsuited to go about London independently.
Without conscious intent, her whole appearance laid
her open to the chance of being mistaken for quite other
than she was; and she had all the vain-glorious
self-confidence of a very young, very ignorant girl.  If
she came off scatheless, it would be because her type is
so plentiful, and by no means because of her discretion.
</p>

<p>
Carol Mayne, when presented to this young lady, as
one of Melicent's Fransdale cousins, was guilty of the
rudeness of staring.  He could not believe that he had
heard correctly, as he contemplated the lithe figure, the
lounging attitude, the lumpy hair, the cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Not&mdash;one of the Vicarage cousins?" he asked, in
amazement.
</p>

<p>
Theo was delighted as she saw him visibly trying to
adjust her with his preconceived notion of the strictly
brought up Miss Coopers.
</p>

<p>
"My father being a priest doesn't make me a
priestess!" she cried.  Her voice was a little too loud
at all times.  "That's where the English make their big
mistake.  My mother thinks she has every bit as much
right to go round lecturing the parishioners as my father
has; but that's just tommy-rot, you know.  We're
always telling her she hasn't any official status.  You're
not married, are you, Mr. Mayne?"
</p>

<p>
"There isn't any room in the colonies for the English
provincial vicarage life," he replied good-humouredly,
mentally contrasting this flower of modern girlhood
with his late ward, and trying to realise that this
young lady's parents had thought her contaminated
by Melicent's companionship.
</p>

<p>
"Are you living in town?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I'm on the boards," said Theo, leaning forward
to toss her cigarette stump into the fire.  "Keen on the
theatre?" she asked casually.
</p>

<p>
Carol looked at Burmester, who was enjoying his
friend's consternation.  The Cooper girls were the
young man's horror and annoyance.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the door was pushed open, and
Melicent came quietly in.
</p>

<p>
She had been told who was there, and was on guard.
</p>

<p>
She knew why Mayne had come.  He wanted to
know how his conspiracy was progressing.  Very well;
he would get nothing out of her.
</p>

<p>
Lance hurried to her.  "So you've been to look at
old Brooke's ancestral acres?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  She sat down after greeting the company.
Her tone was colourless.
</p>

<p>
"Dear," said Brenda, "I hope you've had some food;
I told them to keep it hot."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, thanks.  How's Pater getting on?"
</p>

<p>
"He's very anxious to hear what you've done."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know that I've done very much."
</p>

<p>
"You look tired."
</p>

<p>
"I am.  Such a horrid journey.  I wish Pater could
have come."
</p>

<p>
"Why, was Captain Brooke not cordial?" asked
Brenda, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, quite, thanks.  Only I don't know that I shall
undertake the commission after all; it's such a big
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Millie!"  Brenda almost gasped, for this speech was
wholly out of character with the habitual utterances of
Miss Lutwyche, among whose failings diffidence could
not be reckoned.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll never get on," said Theo earnestly.
"Hitch your waggon to a star, my dear.  You
might live to be fifty, and never get such another
chance."
</p>

<p>
"That's very true," said Melicent, with curious emphasis.
</p>

<p>
Then she remembered Mayne's presence, and could
have bitten out her tongue.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of Brooke, eh, Miss Lutwyche?"
asked Lance, eager to have his friend approved.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I thought him rather&mdash;what shall I
say&mdash;capricious, unstable," she said, and was met with a
simultaneous protest from both men.
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't say that of Brooke!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you both know him, of course, and I don't,"
said she composedly.  "But I thought him a little
undecided.  Seemed quite ready, at a moment's
whim, to throw up his idea of building in Wiltshire,
and try another county, after he had bought the
land."
</p>

<p>
"If he is like that, it would be better not to undertake
his work, I should think," said Brenda, in tones of
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"But, Mrs. Helston, I assure you he's not like that!"
cried Mayne, with warmth.  "And he's rich enough to
build two houses if he wants them."
</p>

<p>
"He seemed to like the ideas I suggested," said
Melicent, leaning back restfully in a corner of the sofa.
"I daresay I shall get on all right.  I'm a bit tired
to-night, but I feel better already for the comforts of
home.  I know how it is that men often come home of
an evening as cross as two sticks.  How goes the world
with you, Theo?" she went on, as Brenda left the room
to see if her husband wanted anything.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not so bad!  Bates"&mdash;her agent&mdash;"thinks he
knows of a crib for me.  Gertie Gordon's got it; but
she's too stumpy, and they're going to sack her; and
it lies between Lillie Billington and me.  I'm going to
see Freeman to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Freeman?  Then it's musical light comedy?  I
thought that wasn't your line."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, when you're a beginner, you take what
you can get," said Theo coolly.
</p>

<p>
"That's the worst of it, I should think.  Is it a good
part?"
</p>

<p>
"Ra-ther!  Principal boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Principal boy!"  Melicent thought of the Vicarage
at Fransdale.  But her attention was diverted by the
gentlemen rising to go.  Evidently Theo meant to stay,
and her presence prevented either of them from carrying
out the design with which they had come.
</p>

<p>
Lance's manner, as he spoke of their early meeting
again, was so significant, so obviously fraught with
admiration, that the girl could not mistake it.  As
she stood by him, near the door, while he took
his leave, an idea darted into the back of her mind.
</p>

<p>
Bert would be powerless to pursue her if she were
married to someone else.
</p>

<p>
It was very different from the career she had planned.
She wanted to build up a future, not to resign herself
to a level, monotonous domesticity.  But under the
pressure of her present scare, the bare notion of any
way of escape was welcome.
</p>

<p>
Carol departed with a distinct sense of disappointment.
He hardly knew what he had hoped.  But the
impression he took away with him was that Bert
had wholly failed to please or interest Millie.  Not
for a moment did he guess that the secret was out.
Under such circumstances, with the state of feeling
which she had so lately confessed to him, he would
not have thought her self-possession possible.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Melicent walked back to her seat by the
fire, where Theo had lighted another cigarette.  On
her homeward journey she had had time to decide
upon her plan of action.  She was not going to say a
word of her discovery to anybody.
</p>

<p>
Her first impulse had been vehemently to reproach
Carol Mayne for treachery; but reflection had showed
that she could not do this without Bert being made
aware that she knew him.  To tell the Helstons would
be to subject herself to the continual fret of knowing
herself observed.  They might even urge her to tell
Bert that she knew; or counsel her to give up this
building scheme, to which her ambition turned with
fierce longing.  She felt sure, in spite of her diffident
words, that she could design and build at Lone Ash a
house which should make her reputation.  To do this
in peace, she must keep her own counsel.  After all,
this was nobody's affair but her own.  If Bert had come
for her, as seemed fatally obvious, it all rested with him
and with her.  Single-handed he had engaged on the
contest, and single-handed she would fight him.  There
seemed something a little cowardly in calling in the
Helstons to her rescue.  She did not mean to marry
him.  Well!  He would soon find that out.  There
were plenty of girls in England for a man of property
to woo successfully&mdash;Theo, for instance.
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
"Theo!" she said abruptly, "you've got to mind
what you're about.  There was a girl at school with
me who went on the stage, and she did what you are
doing&mdash;signed an agreement as principal boy&mdash;and she
found she had done for herself.  Ever after, she had
only boys' parts offered her.  'Oh,' said they, 'you can't
object, you have done it before.'  She left the stage in
consequence.  Of course, for all I know, you may prefer
being boy, but I thought I would just warn you what to
expect."
</p>

<p>
"Awfully good of you," said Theo.  She smoked in
silence for a minute, then broke out: "Anyway, I'm
not going another tour with Tarver's Company.  After
that Minnie Leslie's husband turning up, as I told you,
at Crewe, when she was in rooms with&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'Tsha!'"  It was a little soft sound of disgust that
Millie was prone to make.  "Look here, Theo, if you
really are going on with this kind of life, your only way
to keep clean is to turn your back on all that kind of
thing.  Don't be mixed up in it&mdash;don't talk about it."
</p>

<p>
"It's the agent that counts," said Theo evasively.
"Bates is a right good sort, and he isn't going to see me
let in, you bet I was pretty careful what agent I went
to.  I know the ropes, though you think me a country
bumpkin.  I can't help knowing that Batey's going to
give me every lift he can."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Milicent bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"Because he thinks there's money in me."
</p>

<p>
This was unanswerable.

CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
THE WAY OUT

<p class="poem2">
  "Can it be right to give what I can give?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The mild spring weather made strolling in the garden
pleasant, even in the keen air of Fransdale.  Carol
Mayne strolled accordingly, in company with Mr. Hall
of Ilberston, and forgot manifold preoccupations in the
pleasure of his company.
</p>

<p>
The last fortnight had been a curious and trying
period in his life.  He had become a mere bystander,
where he had previously been a confidant.  He was in
the position of the trainer who has coached his man and
sent him into the ring, and now has no more that he
can do but to watch the conflict.  Bert had stepped
down into the arena, and had ever since ignored Carol
to the point of rudeness.  He had refused interviews,
shirked even looks; had borne in total silence the daily
rebuffs inflicted by Melicent&mdash;the continual pin-pricks
of indifference under which he smarted.
</p>

<p>
Carol would have liked to hold the sponge between
these preliminary rounds, but this was denied him.
Perhaps, when some knock-out blow was dealt, his
champion would have need of him.  Just now, he was
nowhere in the scheme of things.
</p>

<p>
But so deeply had he grown attached to this man
that there was an unexpected degree of suffering
entailed by the sight of his pain.  Day by day his eye
detected more and more of the old Bert surging up
baffled, dogged, passionate, under the fine bearing of
Captain Brooke.  He remembered so well how things
had gone in the old days&mdash;how long the big man would
endure, and then suddenly, the oath that showed him
goaded past bearing, the brief rage, the wild repentance.
Twice he had seen Melicent&mdash;as he believed,
unconsciously&mdash;bring things to this point, and Bert only save
himself by immediate departure.  But not a word of
complaint, or of any kind of feeling, was to be got out
of him afterwards.  The thing seemed too deep, too
momentous for comment to be possible.  A kind of
terror grew in Mayne as the days went by.  What
would happen if Bert were ultimately foiled?  He
could not foresee it, even dimly.  He looked at the slip
of a girl who swayed the man's wild blood, and tried to
choke back his secret fear that tragedy might be the
outcome of it all.
</p>

<p>
For Bert had encountered a rival on the very
threshold of his enterprise; and the rival was the man
whose life he had saved, at risk of his own, because he
knew that through him he could get the introduction to
Millie which he craved.
</p>

<p>
That Lance should admire Melicent was in itself no
bad thing.  It was no doubt well that Bert should not
find himself alone in the field.  But as the days went
by, it was clear to Carol, who thought of nothing else,
and watched all that went on, that Millie was, by her
own conduct, whether of set purpose or no, leading
Lance on to be serious, where at first he had merely
been making holiday.
</p>

<p>
For Lance she broke through the crystal armour of
"stand-offishness" which she usually wore.  She talked
to him; as a rule, she listened only to men, saying
little.  But she gave to Lance looks, smiles, and low
tones.
</p>

<p>
To Bert her manner was quite friendly, even cordial,
as from an unknown artist to her first patron.  But of
good fellowship there was not a trace.  So clever was
she that in all this fortnight Carol had not been
able to determine whether it was by accident or design
that she had never for one minute been <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
Captain Brooke.  Had he known the girl as thoroughly
as he knew the man, the underlying strain must have
been visible to him as it was to two who loved and
understood her&mdash;Brenda Helston and Mr. Hall.  Brenda
thought she knew its cause&mdash;that it was the result of
the sudden fulfilling of the girl's hopes, the terror
lest her first great effort should end in failure, and
her professional prospects be injured by her having
undertaken what was beyond her powers.
</p>

<p>
This was in a measure true.  But not the whole truth.
Melicent's real preoccupation lay deeper; it was more
complicated.  How could she build Bert's house, and
keep clear of Bert himself?
</p>

<p>
If she meant to have nothing to do with him, as she
vehemently did, was it honest, was it wise, was it even
sensible, to go on with the building?
</p>

<p>
But pride was at present a far stronger factor with
Millie than self-sacrifice.  At the first suggestion that
she should design a really big thing, her ambitions had
flown skyward.  In spite of her secret knowledge, she
knew that she meant to go on.
</p>

<p>
"That's a fine fellow, that friend of yours, Captain
Brooke," said Mr. Hall musingly to Carol, as they
paused to look at the first game of tennis that season,
now in progress on the Helston's court at Glen Royd.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; he's an unusual person," said Mayne.  "He
says odd things at times.  Last night, up at Ilbersdale,
we got talking in the smoking-room about the different
things men mean when they speak of love.  Most of
the things said had the materialistic tendency which I
find to be characteristic of English thought to-day.
Then suddenly Brooke, who seldom argues, came out
with his opinion.  He said that the difference between
passion and love was comparable to the difference
between fact and truth.  They asked him to define the
difference between fact and truth, and he answered
without a moment's hesitation that he thought that was
obvious; fact is temporal and truth eternal.  How does
that strike you?"
</p>

<p>
"Then he suggested that passion is temporal, and
love eternal, just in the same way?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I have been thinking it out, and there's a deal
of truth in it.  One of the men asked him how you were
to distinguish between the temporal thing and the
eternal, and he quite simply answered that you could
only tell in the result.  They then said much what was
said to Christ on the subject&mdash;that it is not good to
marry.  He replied that we were in the same case
with all big things.  We have to take chances in life.
Nobody can say how anything will turn out until they
try.  He said, in love, as in religion, as in art, as in all
big business undertakings, you don't have to hold an
opinion merely, but to live a life.  They chaffed him
tremendously about being a devout lover, but it had
simply no effect at all upon him."
</p>

<p>
"He must certainly be unusual!  I should like to
know more of him.  He might be strong enough to tame
my wild bird."
</p>

<p>
"Your wild bird?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean your ward, Miss Lutwyche.  She needs a
deal of taming.  She is full of fine qualities, but has no
chance to exercise them, all things being well with her.
She is spoilt, as the only child proverbially is.
However, as your friend says, we must leave it to life to
teach her various things that she will have to learn."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, Carol's eye was following Melicent, who
had finished playing, and was arranging another sett.
She had not once played in the same sett as Brooke.
Now she put him to play with Theo, against Sybil
Ayres and a curate.  She was sorry for Theo, who had,
after all, not succeeded in obtaining Gertie Gordon's
"crib," and was still "resting" according to the language
of her profession&mdash;a euphemism which ought to have
delighted Mr. Cooper.
</p>

<p>
Lancelot had been Melicent's partner, and was at
her heels.
</p>

<p>
"You promised to show me the latest treasure-trove,"
he said, "and I've been waiting all the afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"We found it at Citta della Piève," she said, "and I
really do believe it is valuable.  Pater is wonderful, he
has such an eye for the real thing."
</p>

<p>
She led the way to a little garden-house which was
Harry Helston's workshop, and lifted a cloth carefully
from an object which lay on the table.
</p>

<p>
It was the oaken figure of a winged child, with
dimpled hands and feet, and exquisite face.  It had
evidently been wrenched from a frieze or mantel-carving
of leaves and flowers.  Great part of the surface was
still coated in grey mould, but the face and throat had
been skilfully cleansed.
</p>

<p>
"He is treating it with glass paper, and it's slow
work," said Melicent, touching the angel with soft,
appreciative fingers.  "It was broken in two places,
but he has mended it perfectly.  When it is polished,
it is going to be the finial of the baluster in the hall."
</p>

<p>
"Jove, he is clever!" said Lance.  "What a house this
is!  One feels that a mind created it!  Brooke's a lucky
chap if he's going to have such another."
</p>

<p>
Melicent laughed:
</p>

<p>
"We shan't exploit Tuscany for him, unless we get a
special commission to do so," she said.  "But he is so
rich, he can have what he chooses."
</p>

<p>
"How go the plans?"
</p>

<p>
"He seems to like them very much.  But I have
made two alternative elevations, and he has not yet
decided between them.  Pater has helped me
tremendously, of course.  But I'm afraid I'm neglecting
your father's cottages."
</p>

<p>
"He is very pleased with the drawings, I can tell you.
Who would have thought you were such a genius?
But do you know, I feel very proud of myself.  I said
so from the first."
</p>

<p>
"Said what?"
</p>

<p>
"That you were something wonderful.  Do you
remember"&mdash;his voice grew soft&mdash;"how you sat up
on the Rigg, on Tod's Trush, and we came by, and
you shot a grouse with my gun?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I remember."
</p>

<p>
"I said afterwards, to Helston, that there was
something wonderful about you, I felt a power in
you..."
</p>

<p>
He broke off mute, like most of his countrymen, in
face of an emotion.  Putting his hands in his pockets,
he strolled round the little room, idly taking up bits
of carved wood and stone, tools and drawings, and
laying them down again.  Melicent neither moved nor
spoke.  She stood silent beside the oaken angel.
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful," he suddenly began again&mdash;"don't
you think it's wonderful, how sometimes one's identity
seems to come up against someone else's, and a response
sounds, as if we were two Marconi instruments, and
were in tune with each other.  Have you noticed that?"
</p>

<p>
"I know what you mean."
</p>

<p>
He came nearer and stood beside her.
</p>

<p>
"The thing goes on a long time, before you're
conscious of it; at least, it did with me.  When I got
to London, I didn't realise why I wanted to go straight
and call upon the Helstons, until&mdash;until I saw you
come into the room.  Then I knew that all the while
I was in Africa, I had been thinking about you....
Are you angry?" for she had turned away a little.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not angry.  But ... you know very little
of me.  I ... never thought about you like that."
</p>

<p>
"No, I daresay not.  But as to knowing&mdash;when two
people are tuned together, intimacy comes, one hardly
knows how.  This Easter has been the jolliest time I
have ever known.  I feel like the chap in Locksley
Hall, who thought the grass was greener than usual,
and the birds brighter coloured....  This spring is like
that to me, because of you&mdash;because of you! ... <i>Melicent</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The girl looked up.  She was of those whom excitement
renders pale.  Her cheek was white, but as if a
fire shone through the whiteness.  Here was the way
definitely open to her, out of the intolerable strain of
the past ten day.  But she was honest.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to disappoint you," she said slowly.  "I
must.  I don't feel like that.  I don't believe I ever
should.  My enthusiasm seems to be for things, not
people.  I am ambitious and selfish.  I suppose, to be
ambitious is always to be selfish."
</p>

<p>
His voice was uneven and broken now, as if it fell
over rough edges.
</p>

<p>
"You can only disappoint me by saying that you
care for ... some other fellow ... more than for me."
</p>

<p>
"I like you better than anybody else," said Melicent
simply, raising her eyes to his agitated face.
</p>

<p>
She was quite unprepared for the result.
</p>

<p>
Her hands, her waist, were caught, she was in his
arms; before she was fairly conscious of what he was
about, he had kissed the ineffable, smooth rose whiteness
of her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"I'm content," he whispered.  "You like me better
than anybody else!  Oh, you darling!  What is it?
Have I frightened you?  There, I will be good, I swear
I will!  I'm not a brute ... only I lost my head!  I
never thought you would, or could, but now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She edged away, sick and trembling.  To her virginal
aloofness, the fact of his embrace clinched the matter.
He had stolen a march on her.  Unless he were her
betrothed, how could she face him again?  He would
become a second incubus, like Bert Mestaer.  Yet still
her honesty fought for liberty.
</p>

<p>
"You did not let me speak," she cried.  "I mean to
say&mdash;I like you better than anybody else, but that is
not enough!"
</p>

<p>
"But it is enough," he cried triumphantly.  "You
say yourself that you are cold&mdash;I don't care a shot for
that, I want you as you are.  And if you like me best,
what more is there?  I'm not as clever as you, but I
can give you money and a title, and I did well in the
campaign....  By the way, I shall be more deeply
indebted than ever to old Brooke!  If it hadn't been
for him&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
The mention of the name was opportune.  It stiffened
up the girl's resolution.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; he saved your life!  Tell me about it!" she
said, with an idea of gaining time to collect her thoughts,
which seemed to be circling in a kind of whirlpool,
nearer and nearer to complete surrender.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to hear?" he cried; and fell to
musing for a moment.  "We were crossing the Vaal,
you know," he said.  "It's celebrated for its rapid
risings.  The ford was quite easy when the first chaps
went over, and in half an hour it was impassable.
There was a commando not far behind us, and we knew,
if we could get across, they couldn't follow, so we made
a push for it I, as you know, was correspondent, not
combatant; and it so happened that I had been with
another column that morning, and had ridden hard to
pick up with Lacy's.  My horse was completely done.
I was hardly knee-deep when I knew she would be
washed away.  Swimming against that current wasn't
possible; I just grit my teeth and prepared to drown.
But by instinct I worked my feet out of the stirrups,
and we worried on, until the poor beast's foot rolled on
a big stone and she slipped away, with an awful,
human-sounding scream.  There was a big trooper riding just
above me.  His eyes had been on my face, and he had
ridden all the way, so as to try and break the force of
the water for my mare.  His horse was magnificent;
and, just as I was going under, I found his arm round
my body&mdash;Jove, what a grip!  I wonder he didn't crack
a rib or two.
</p>

<p>
"'Strike out with the other hand' he said in my ear;
'strike out for all you're worth, and I can hold you
up.'  And he did!  My head was mostly under water, but I
gave all the support I could, and his horse got through
with us both!  It seemed to me as if it went on for
days, the fighting with the current, the struggle for
breath; till all at once the water gave way under me,
as it were, and my legs flopped down, and he literally
hauled me out, holding me with his right arm, and I just
clutching on as I best could.  I faintly heard the
cheering as we came ashore, and half a dozen chaps
rushed to catch me, and then I fainted.  They gave
him his commission chiefly for that, I believe, and jolly
well he earned it.  And that was the beginning of our
being chums."
</p>

<p>
She drew a deep breath.  The long arm of coincidence
had not been kind to Bert Mestaer.  But how
could she help that?
</p>

<p>
For ten days now, she had not known a moment's
peace.  Her usual profound, dreamless sleep had
changed to white, wakeful nights of vague, dreadful
apprehension of she knew not what.  This would put
a stop to her nameless fears.  But it had come too
suddenly.  She was not ready.
</p>

<p>
Lance, however, would have no half measures.  He
had not, it is true, come there that day with the deliberate
intention of clinching matters; but a fine opportunity
had presented itself, and he had risen to the occasion
with a success which bewildered and delighted him.
Melicent's suggestion that he should give her time to
think things over was impetuously scouted.  Life was
not long enough for hesitation, he told her, and his
intense confidence did to a certain degree infect her.
They would be married in the summer, and go to
Greece, Sicily&mdash;India, if she liked, to see the
architectural treasures of the world.  Melicent told herself
that it would be very nice indeed.  He was already
embarked upon an idea for their own house, if she
chose to build one, when voices were heard, and steps
on the gravel, and Captain Brooke and Theo peeped
in.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, here they are, looking at some wonderful relic
of the past!" cried Theo.  "What a ridiculous,
mouldering thing!" gazing with a laugh at the oaken
angel.
</p>

<p>
Melicent took up the cloth, without a word, to cover
her treasure from further insult.  Captain Brooke
arrested her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you let me look?"
</p>

<p>
She laid down the cover and moved aside.  The
atmosphere thrilled with a sense of something unusual.
Brooke had no suspicion of the truth.  He knew Lance,
but he thought he also knew Melicent.  The idea of
her taking a husband as a weapon of defence against
himself had not as yet occurred to him.  He looked
quickly, searchingly, into her eyes, to ascertain what
the matter was.
</p>

<p>
The result was curious.  She met his gaze; and
there rose up and revealed itself to him, the feeling
always uppermost in her when he was present, fear.
She did not know that she betrayed it: defiance of his
unspoken question was what she meant to convey.
But he saw fear; and the result was a flood of light
which fairly dazzled him.  He knew that he was
recognised, and his heart rose within him.  If she
feared him, it was because she felt him dangerous.
For the first time since he came to England, he saw
a chance, a loop-hole for hope to enter by.
</p>

<p>
He let his eyes rest upon the angel lest their radiance
should betray him.  In the thrill of consciousness which
his new knowledge&mdash;the knowledge of their mutual
secret&mdash;gave him, he could hardly keep from smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the treasure you found in Italy?" he asked
somewhat hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it beautiful!  I am learning to know beauty
when I see it, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Learning to know beauty when you see it, Captain
Brooke!  Didn't know gentlemen had to be taught
that, as a rule!" cried Theo, laughing affectedly.
</p>

<p>
"You make a great mistake, Miss Cooper," said
Lance.  "Beauty requires a trained eye.  Which do
you suppose a ploughman would rather hang on his
cottage wall&mdash;a Rembrandt etching, or a chromo-lithograph
of the Royal family on an almanack?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, aren't you confusing beauty and art?" said
Melicent, finding her voice again.
</p>

<p>
Theo, who had never heard of a Rembrandt etching,
looked blank.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Helston sent us to fetch you in to tea," she
said.  "Come, Mr. Burmester, we had better let
Melicent continue her treatise on beauty."
</p>

<p>
"She's well qualified to teach, by precept and
example," said Lance, with tender gallantry, standing
aside to let his betrothed and Captain Brooke pass
out.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Theo, when she had procured a minute's
delay by stooping down to disentangle slowly a wisp of
her flouncing from a splinter of wood on the table-leg.
"It's wonderful how well she's turned out, isn't it?
Does her such credit, poor thing, and the Helstons too.
Mother was obliged to send her away, you know;
fortunately Mrs. Helston had no girls.  She seems to
be quite all right now, doesn't she?  You would never
guess what she came from."
</p>

<p>
Lance was so astonished that for a moment he could
not speak.  At last he said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand.  Are you talking of your
cousin, Miss Lutwyche?  I thought her mother was
the vicar's sister?"
</p>

<p>
"So she was; but you see, poor Aunt Melicent
married a brute.  It was a runaway match, of course.
I can't tell you what he did&mdash;drank himself to death,
or something of the kind.  I believe my aunt died of a
broken heart It's a wretched story.  But oh, I
forgot!  Papa does not like us to speak of it, on poor
Millie's account.  He thinks it would be so bad for her
if such a thing got about, so you must try and forget
what I have said!  I am so heedless!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed boisterously.  Lance was furious.  He
had always disliked the Cooper girls, this turned his
dislike to positive rancour.  He felt sure that almost
the whole of what he heard was mere ill-natured
calumny.  Still, there is no smoke without fire, and his
self-esteem received a jolt.  He was the eldest son of a
baronet, and though the Burmester blood was not blue,
it was very respectable.  What would his parents say to
a bride whose antecedents were shady?
</p>

<p>
His discomposure was momentary.  His eye fell upon
the proud, careless grace of Melicent as she walked
along the path before him.  She was giving Captain
Brooke a fluent account of the finding of the oaken
angel, which left him no chance to put in a word until
they reached the others.

CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
THE END OF THE FIRST ROUND
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Go, if you will!  Let continents divide us,<br>
  And put the seas between, and sink the ships!<br>
  What space shall sunder us, what darkness hide us,<br>
  What force shall keep apart our meeting lips?"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
One of Captain Brooke's first purchases when he came
to England was a motor; and it had since been Carol
Mayne's fate to be driven hither and thither by a driver
whose want of skill at first was only equalled by his
recklessness.  Now he had mastered the art, as he
mastered most of the things he cared to try; and it fell
out that he drove Mayne and Burmester home from
the Glen Royd tennis-party, the early spring air being
chilly, and the ladies of the party all preferring Sir
Joseph's motor, which was closed.
</p>

<p>
He took his seat at the wheel, with Mayne beside
him and Lance behind, in the <i>tonneau</i>.  They had not gone
far before Lance brought out his secret.  His people
had not been told yet, he said, but these two were his
very good friends, and he must make known to them
the great news that he had proposed to Miss Lutwyche
that afternoon and been accepted by her.
</p>

<p>
To Mayne the thing was like a bomb exploding in a
non-combatant country.  It was utterly unlooked for.
He had seen that something was afoot, of course&mdash;had
had vague fears that by the end of the summer perhaps...
</p>

<p>
And now it was suddenly all over.  His champion
had been knocked out in the first round.  To such a
man as Carol the announcement had all the effect of a
hopeless finality.  Melicent was betrothed; then Bert's
chance was over.  He almost expected to see him reel
visibly under the blow.  Of course the ordinary man is
not openly affected by such things.  We most of us in
our time have to listen politely while somebody
cheerfully calls upon us for congratulation upon the
circumstance that is defeating our hopes.  But to Bert
this news meant the loss of all things.  His money, his
lands, his education, all he had and was, existed for
Melicent....
</p>

<p>
The Bishop elect felt himself turning cold.  Visions
of possible tragedy had brushed his eyes with their dark
wing that afternoon, and behold, already the darkness
was upon them.  Once before, after Bert's long patience,
at the moment of fruition, Carol had stepped in and
asked him to forego.  He remembered the effect of
brute strength in leash, the impact, almost physical, of
this man's will against his own.  And then he had been
able to hold out hope, to say: "Wait, and try again
when you have proved yourself."
</p>

<p>
But this time it was final!
</p>

<p>
What would Bert do?  Would his civilisation, his
Christianity, even his manhood, be proof against this
stroke of Fate?
</p>

<p>
It had been better far for him to present himself
avowedly to the girl, to say: "Behold the result of my
long effort to be more worthy of you.  Will you try to
learn to love me?"
</p>

<p>
Mayne had counselled this all along; but Bert had,
as usual, taken his own way.
</p>

<p>
Mayne's eyes were fixed apprehensively upon the firm
hands grasping the wheel.  He almost expected some
explosion, some display of violent resentment, of
ungoverned temper, that should shoot them all down into
the ravine on their left, where the limekiln smoked blue
against the dark moor beyond.
</p>

<p>
There was not even a change of colour.  Bert
continued to look out keenly along the road, as his
manner was when driving.
</p>

<p>
"Asked Miss Lutwyche to marry you?" he said, in
a preoccupied voice.  "What on earth d'you do that for?"
</p>

<p>
Lance was silent for a moment, in something closely
approaching stupefaction.  Carol stared at Bert, in
whose temples he saw a pulse visibly throbbing; no
other sign of discomposure.
</p>

<p>
"Surely you've seen, Brooke, that I was hard hit in
that direction?" said Lance presently, in a hurt tone.
</p>

<p>
"Saw you admired her, of course; but so do I," said
Bert shortly.  "Had no idea you had made up your mind."
</p>

<p>
"You must forgive our lack of warmth, Burmester,"
said Mayne.  "It seems to me very sudden.  But you
know they say, 'Happy's the wooing that's not long
a-doing.'"
</p>

<p>
"You don't know enough of each other," said Bert,
still in that preoccupied tone, as though his mind was
concentrated on the road before him.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Lance, "but what were you saying last
night in the smoking-room?  One has got to take one's
chances.  It is true, and it was that that gave me courage
to speak to-day."
</p>

<p>
Mayne saw the blood slowly overspread Bert's face.
Lance, behind, could not see the sardonic grin which
accompanied the manifestation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems I've made myself responsible for a
big order," remarked the <i>chauffeur</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think she's charming?" said Lance
anxiously.  "Charming in such a very unusual way?
You know, lots of girls are pretty, but you feel you'd
so soon get tired of 'em&mdash;run through 'em, so to speak,
if Mayne will pardon the expression.  But with her&mdash;"
his voice broke and softened.
</p>

<p>
Bert put on power, then jammed down the brake,
as an opportune cart came galloping downhill towards
them; opportune, because it enabled him to say
"Damn!" with expression, to violently control the
rocking car, and to be occupied with it busily.  When
he spoke again, which was not for several minutes,
during which Mayne vainly searched his own mind for
a suitable remark, it was to say:
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do about St. Petersburg?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Lance, unpleasantly reminded.
</p>

<p>
It was only a fortnight since he had been rejoicing in
the offer, made to him by his newspaper, of going to
Russia under very favourable conditions.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, after a pause, "that will have to be
referred to&mdash;"  Bert made his whistle hoot so noisily
that the final word was lost.
</p>

<p>
When they drew up at the door of the Grange, Bert
said to Mayne, upon whom he had not bestowed glance
nor sign:
</p>

<p>
"Mayne, like a good chap, see if there's any post for
me before I send this machine away."
</p>

<p>
Mayne went in, and sent out the servant with a
bundle of correspondence, of that unclassified kind
which the rich man and the buyer is always burdened
withal.  Brooke sat in the car, opening envelope after
envelope; and after a minute, Mayne came slowly
down the steps again and stood near, his eyes soft with
sympathy, but no words on his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said the Captain at last, as though to himself.
"Yes; that's what I expected.  Well, I think I shall be
off at once, and take my machine to Wiltshire by road."
</p>

<p>
After a moment's surprise: "A good idea," said
Mayne heartily.
</p>

<p>
Bert looked at him as if he had never seen him before.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said, "you think so, do you?"  Then
turning to Sir Joseph's <i>chauffeur</i>, who waited: "Tell
my man to be ready in an hour to take me to London,"
he said laconically, getting out of the car as he spoke.
"I must go and apologise to Lady B."  he remarked, with
a grin, as he passed Mayne.  "See you later, old man.
These are my builders' estimates, and I must get on
with that house of mine."
</p>

<p>
"But"&mdash;Mayne was so mystified that he followed
him through the hall&mdash;"but if your architect is&mdash;what
I mean to suggest is, that she may not be able to carry
out&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Brooke turned and faced him with clear grey eyes
that had the effect of a locked door.
</p>

<p>
"She's signed her contract," he said, "and if she don't
keep to it, I'll go to law and make her.  But this is
business: women aren't so unbusiness-like as you seem
to suppose.  Forman, where's her ladyship?"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
There is little doubt that her son's engagement would
have been wholly unpleasing to Lady Burmester had
it not been for one fact which, curiously enough, made
her look more favourably upon it.  This was nothing
else than the total lack of enthusiasm with which the
Helstons regarded the new idea.
</p>

<p>
The thing was sudden; on Melicent's side they had
noticed no symptoms.  They thought it rash and
ill-considered.  No doubt many young people made up a
match upon equally slender acquaintance; in fact, one
way and another, before Lance went abroad, he and
Melicent had seen a good deal of one another.
Undoubtedly, from the worldly point of view, it
was an excellent match for their girl.  The thing that
distressed them was that they felt sure her heart was
not in it.
</p>

<p>
"But in that case&mdash;why?" they asked each other
blankly.
</p>

<p>
They thought they knew her too well to imagine
that the social advantages weighed enough in her eyes
to turn the scale.  They were simply mystified,
without a clue.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you are wise, my child?" said Brenda
earnestly, when first discussing it with her adopted
daughter.  "You know we have always spoken out
frankly to each other.  Don't let us forego that habit.
Tell me plainly.  You care for Lance deeply?  He's
a charming fellow, I know, but weak.  Have you
realised that he is weak, Melicent?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't like strong men," said the girl, with a
perceptible shudder.  "There's something brutal about
all strength, even moral strength.  I fear it."
</p>

<p>
This speech deepened the darkness in which Brenda
groped.  She could not fathom it.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I understand his feeling for you," she
said slowly.  "You are just the woman for him, and
he has penetration to see it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you won't give me the credit for like penetration?
Why shouldn't I see it too?  Isn't that kind
of thing generally mutual?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you tell me it is so ... but it seems to me
so rapid."
</p>

<p>
"It was unexpected to me," said Melicent thoughtfully.
"I did ask him to give me time to think.  But
he seemed so sure.  You know, mater, I don't think I
should ever smile and cry and bill and coo.  I'm not
that kind.  But I know I like Lance better than
anybody else.  If I find that we don't get on, I could
break it off, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Burmester would never forgive that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother Lady Burmester!"
</p>

<p>
"There!  That's the mood I distrust!" cried Brenda.
"Melicent, you're behaving like a child!  You will have
to consider your husband's relations, and especially his
mother!  This is real life, remember.  You are not
going away to live in an enchanted castle."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems to me that you want me to act as if
I were, and doubt me because I speak sensibly!" cried
Melicent, hurt.
</p>

<p>
Brenda began to see that she had made up her mind.
For the first time&mdash;the very first time since she took
this orphan to her heart&mdash;she was conscious of feeling
jarred.  She ceased to argue, but went instead to her
own room and wept.
</p>

<p>
This was early in the day.  Lancelot and his parents
came to lunch.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Helston was quite outspoken.  He said his
position briefly was that he was a man of moderate
fortune, with two brothers, both with large and needy
families.  He could not feel justified in leaving much
to his adopted daughter, as he had carefully explained
to her uncle when he first took her.  He had carried
out his plan of giving her a first-rate education and a
means of livelihood; and as long as he or his wife
lived, she had a home.  But she was a poor match for
a prospective baronet.
</p>

<p>
Sir Joseph asked a few questions as to her birth and
parentage, which Mr. Helston answered as fully as he
could.  Her father, Arnold Lutwyche, was a member
of a reputable family which had gone to the West
Indies, and there gained, and subsequently lost, a large
fortune.  He had no near relations, being the last of
his line, and had been brought up in a luxury which,
after the early death of his parents, had been found to
be wholly unjustified.  He had married Mr. Chetwynd-Cooper's
sister, against the wish of her family, the
opposition being solely on pecuniary grounds.  Melicent
had been sent to England on his death, her mother
having predeceased him.
</p>

<p>
In his brief account of her home-coming, and
Mr. Mayne's guardianship, Helston made no mention
whatever of the Boer half-brothers and sisters, simply
because he never thought about them.  From the day
of Melicent's first arrival in England, no word had come
from Tante Wilma.  Melicent herself never seemed to
realise that the Boer woman's children were in any way
akin to her.  The stupor of coldness which had congealed
her heart in the old days had seemingly rendered
her incapable of loving anybody.  Even now she loved
but few; and those slowly, and, as it were, with difficulty.
She repudiated her African life so wholly that Helston
and his wife had hardly ever heard her speak of it.
</p>

<p>
But Brenda was urgent in recommending delay.  She
thought Sir Joseph ought to bring pressure to bear upon
his son not to go forward in the matter at present.  She
owned that she was not altogether certain of Melicent's
feelings.  It was then that Lancelot's mother showed
cold surprise.  Naturally she did not find it difficult to
believe that her son's attractions had proved fatal.
</p>

<p>
"Lancelot himself seems to have no doubts," she
said.  "It is possible he may understand the woman he
loves better than you yourself, Mrs. Helston."
</p>

<p>
"That is very possible," said Brenda.
</p>

<p>
"His particular reason for wishing the engagement
announced," said Sir Joseph, "is that his newspaper
wishes him to go to St. Petersburg on a three months'
commission.  He would like to be married on his
return, in the summer.  His mother and I have every
desire to see him settled, and he is by no means a boy
who has given trouble in the way of flirtations&mdash;I mean,
that I feel tolerably sure of his knowing his own mind;
and that being so, I should not feel justified in putting
obstacles in his way."
</p>

<p>
Brenda was aghast.  She tried to say that her main
objection to the engagement was the insufficient knowledge
of each other possessed by the contracting couple;
and that, if they were to be separated during the whole
of their betrothal, and married with little chance of
improving acquaintance, she felt considerable anxiety
for their chances of future happiness.
</p>

<p>
It ended by Lady Burmester taking up the cudgels
definitely on behalf of Romance.  She naturally felt it
most unlikely that, quite apart from the question of
position, any girl could ever possibly repent marriage
with her boy.  She seemed inclined to treat
Mrs. Helston's hesitation as an implied slight upon an
exemplary son.
</p>

<p>
When Brenda found that Melicent herself was against
her, she surrendered.  The arrangement was in truth
just what the girl had wished for.  Her engagement
would be merely nominal for the next three months
while Lone Ash was in building.  It would be there, an
impregnable barrier against Hubert Mestaer, and in no
sense a drag upon herself.  The calmness with which
she faced the idea of parting from her lover added the
final touch to Mrs. Helston's conviction that there was
something desperately wrong.  She began to think she
must be mistaken in her girl after all.  Was her head
really turned on finding herself the chosen of one of
the county eligibles?  It must be so.  Doubtless the girl
herself did not realise it.  Excitement lent a glamour
to the situation, and Melicent, like many another silly
maid, mistook the glitter for the rainbow glory of the
wings of the Love-god whom she had never seen.
</p>

<p>
Not even her husband could understand the full
depth of Brenda's disappointment.  It seemed to her
that she would have to learn Melicent all over again.
She brooded over the subject continually, searching and
searching for a motive for conduct which nobody but
herself found in the least unnatural.
</p>

<br><br>
THREE MONTHS' TRUCE

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was, however, much in Melicent's new position
which was irksome, and to her inexperience, wholly
unexpected.  She had not foreseen that the event would
make a stir in the county, and bring her into a
prominence much accented by the fact that she was
a qualified architect, now occupied in building a
gentleman's country-seat.
</p>

<p>
Sir Joseph's paternal kiss was an infliction which
positively scared her; and the influx of congratulatory
visitors still worse.
</p>

<p>
"Capital, Melicent darling!" was Mrs. Cooper's
honeyed sting; "you are quite a lesson to us all in
overcoming unfortunate tendencies!  I always quote
you to anybody who complains to me of children that
are difficult to manage."
</p>

<p>
Lancelot was out of earshot when this amenity
was uttered; but Mr. Helston heard it, and, being
unregenerate, hit back.
</p>

<p>
"Talking of children that are difficult to manage," he
said, "what news have you of George?"
</p>

<p>
"A most amusing letter," promptly replied the vicar,
who was always ready, with armour girt on, to defend
his own.  "He gives a capital account of the colonial
method of pooling labour for harvesting purposes.  Had
you that custom among the Boers, Millie?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Melicent.  "Ask Captain Brooke."
</p>

<p>
"Brooke's gone back to town," said Helston.  "He
went off last night on his motor.  He is going to take
it to Clunbury by road."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Millie, "I wish he had taken me!
Travelling all night too!  I should have enjoyed it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried her aunt, "we must really tell
Mr. Burmester this!  You must remember, Melicent
darling, that you are appropriated now.  It would never
do to make Mr. Burmester jealous."
</p>

<p>
"Really, Aunt Minna," said Melicent disgustedly,
"one would think you were the under-housemaid."
</p>

<p>
She walked away, with her head in the air, after this
unpardonable speech, and told Lancelot that she could
not stand Fransdale now that she was engaged; they
must go back to town at once.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Lance, "of course I ought to be back,
only I was waiting till you went.  We'll travel
together."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke's off, I hear."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the builders' estimates for that confounded
house came in, and he was off like a shot; thinks of
nothing else but his house and his motor car; hardly
took any notice when I told him we were engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," said Melicent vaguely; "one wouldn't
expect him to be interested in that."
</p>

<p>
"I did.  I do.  He's my friend."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  That's why, I expect!  You see, he knows
me better than you do."
</p>

<p>
Until Lance's blank stare faced her she did not
realise the thing she had said.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," she hastily subjoined, "that he may have
heard all about what a naughty girl I used to be from
Mr. Mayne.  You know, they are great friends."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Lance tenderly, "but Mayne thinks the
world of you."
</p>

<p>
"Does he?" said Melicent, rather wearily.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
In the train, on the way to town, she felt happier.
Things were falling out as she wished.  It was
unconsciously that she was acting with such surpassing
selfishness.  She did not tell herself that she was
fencing herself with an engagement in order to be free
to gratify her ambition.  She did not even know that
at the back of her mind lay the treacherous thought
that, when Lone Ash was built, Lance might be thrown
over.  But a deeper self-knowledge would have shown
her that this was what she really intended.  Her mind
just now was full of dreams: but they were in stone
and mortar.  Visions of corbie-stepped gables, of oriel
windows, of mullions, drip-stones and other bewitching
details, would keep coming in between her and Lance's
scholarly, boyish face opposite.  She and he were at
one end of the carriage, the Helstons, with newspapers
ostentatiously spread, at the other.
</p>

<p>
Lancelot was a good deal elated and somewhat
thrown off his balance by the great fact of his engagement.
He arrived at the railway station brimful of the
idea of writing to his paper to decline the St. Petersburg
mission.  He was terribly dashed at first by his <i>fiancée's</i>
warm opposition to this idea.
</p>

<p>
"You can't care for me, if you can coolly face the
idea of my being away till the end of June!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I never pretended to care for you in that emotional
kind of way; I'm not emotional," said Millie, with
calmness.  "I care with my mind, and I like a man
to go and do his duty, not to hang round a woman's
apron-string.  Look how soldiers and sailors have to
part from the women they love!  You have your name
to make in the world."
</p>

<p>
"I see your point of view," said the lover wistfully,
"but it is a little hard to go off and leave you so soon.
I'm&mdash;I'm very much in love, you know, darling.  You
are the kind of girl men do make fools of themselves
for."
</p>

<p>
Melicent sighed.  Perhaps she was thinking of a
certain cup of coffee streaming down a man's face and
shirt, and the fight that ensued on that swift insult.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you honestly, Lance, I'm not in love with
you," she said.  "It's no use pretending."
</p>

<p>
He was silent, giving her only an ardent look&mdash;a look
that she resented.
</p>

<p>
But she told herself, a man is only in love for such a
short time.  It is the kind of thing a woman must
tolerate and allow until the brief madness passes.
Now with regard to Bert, she doubted if such
well-recognised rules would hold.  He might easily prove
capable of being in love all his life, which made him
inexcusable.  Her fancy ran off again upon this tack,
till she was recalled by hearing Lance say:
</p>

<p>
"If you knew how awful it is to think of leaving
you.  Words don't convey the horrible feeling, the
craving for you, when you are out of my sight."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you don't trust me," she said, with a little
supercilious smile.  "Perhaps you think I shall not keep
faith if you leave me?"
</p>

<p>
"Melicent!"  He insisted upon taking her hand,
unbuttoning and removing her glove, kissing the palm
and holding it to his cheek.  "I shan't say another
word.  I'm the happiest man on earth.  I shall look
on my exile as the proof of my manhood."
</p>

<p>
"I am more likely to value you correctly if you go
away," said Melicent, withdrawing her hand when she
had borne his caress as long as she could.  "I shall
grow used to the idea of you.  I can't adjust my
horizons at present, with you in the foreground.  It
used to be so empty."
</p>

<p>
"And you will spend all to-morrow with me, won't
you?  We will lunch, shop, dine together, go to the
theatre&mdash;we will have one day of happiness, and then
part."
</p>

<p>
One day of happiness!  The girl looked wistfully at him.
</p>

<p>
"Lance, will it truly make you very happy to spend
the day with me?"
</p>

<p>
"I wonder you can ask," he said.  He added a string
of lovers' folly&mdash;tender names and protestations.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, we'll try it!" she cried recklessly.  "I
want a day of happiness too.  You shall take me where
you like, and I shall try and be happy.  I think I am
too cold and selfish.  I'll try and let myself go
to-morrow, and enjoy things, and be sweet to you.  You
shall have a memory to carry to Russia with you&mdash;the
memory of a day as happy as I can make it."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The day of happiness was a pitiable failure as far as
Melicent was concerned.  She did her best, honestly.
She wore her prettiest clothes, and tried hard to be
really interested in jewellery, and to persuade herself
that driving down Bond Street in a hansom, purchasing
a smart diamond ring, lunching at the Trocadero, and
so on, in company with a good-looking, well-dressed,
clever and agreeable young man, constituted the
elements of enjoyment for her.  But it would not do.
She would rather have been wandering alone on
Fransdale Rigg in a storm and a mackintosh; or,
better still, superintending the foundation-laying of
the first child of her genius.
</p>

<p>
After their final leave-taking, and the passionate
demonstration on the part of Lance which she had
not been able to evade, she was almost determining to
put an end to the whole thing.  But when he was gone
the tension relaxed at once.  She liked him very well
at a distance.  Perhaps&mdash;almost certainly&mdash;by the time
he returned, she would find that her affections had
progressed in his direction.  Meanwhile, she blindly felt
the protection of her engagement to be an imperious
necessity in the present circumstances.
</p>

<p>
And three days after the sailing of her lover, the idea
of her approaching wedding had grown dim and far;
for Captain Brooke came to Mr. Helston's office to
consider the builders' estimates.
</p>

<p>
Melicent was at her drawing-board when he came in,
her fair head bent over a piece of delicate work.  The
meeting was expected on both sides, and both were
thoroughly on guard.  Mr. Helston was present, and
after the usual greetings had passed, the Captain,
without pause, offered Melicent his congratulations on her
engagement.
</p>

<p>
"Mayne seemed afraid that you would throw up your
commission and leave me in the lurch in consequence of
more pressing interests," he said.  "I am glad to find
you are more business-like than that."
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid Lance knows that he will have to go
shares with architecture in my heart," she said, slightly
shrugging her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Helston had gone for a moment to the outer office, to
carry a paper to a clerk: the two were alone.
</p>

<p>
"<i>What a fool Burmester must be!</i>" said Brooke
hurriedly, under his breath.
</p>

<p>
She looked up, angry, amazed; but his eyes were in
another direction, and it was impossible for her to
answer him, because Helston immediately returned.
They plunged into business; and thereafter her client's
manner was wholly natural, quiet and business-like.
</p>

<p>
In the course of two or three interviews, the raw
surfaces of Melicent's susceptibilities were healed, her
apprehensions lulled.
</p>

<p>
Fired through and through with professional
enthusiasm, she gave herself heart and soul to the
difficulties and the fascinations of her profession.
</p>

<p>
The glory of it!  To see her Idea taking shape in
material that should endure for ages!  To see dreams
and thoughts reduced to dimensions and proportions
and traced upon the bosom of the ground in foundations
that would be still young, years after their designer was
dust!
</p>

<p>
The circumstances were exceptional.  Her client gave
her <i>carte-blanche</i>, and was to the full as enthusiastic
as she.  The spring was a glorious one.  As the fruit
trees in the old orchard of Lone Ash Farm burst into
flower, the outline of Melicent's creation began to rise
imperishable, on the hill-side.

CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
THE GATES OF SPRING ARE OPENED
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "For rest of body perfect was the spot,<br>
  All that luxurious nature could desire;<br>
  But stirring to the spirit; who could gaze<br>
  And not feel motions there? ...<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gates of Spring<br>
  Are opened; churlish winter hath given leave<br>
  That she should entertain for this one day,<br>
  Perhaps for many genial days to come,<br>
  Her guests, and make them welcome."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;WORDSWORTH (The Recluse).<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a little ceremony when the foundation-stone
of Lone Ash was laid.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Harland, lord of the manor of Clunbury, had an
aged grandmother living in his house, who actually
remembered Captain Brooke's grandfather, and the
departure of the family to South Africa when the old
place was sold up.  This venerable dame, as forming so
interesting a link with the past, was at the Squire's
suggestion, asked to lay the stone; and on the first of
May the ceremony was performed, before quite a
concourse of spectators.
</p>

<p>
It was a fine opportunity for the county to show
sympathy with the eligible owner by being present;
and there was many a pretty girl who would have
dearly liked to preside at future gatherings on the
same spot.
</p>

<p>
For the few with whom he was personally acquainted,
the Captain provided champagne luncheon at the
primitive inn, where he still had his unpretentious
quarters.  Melicent had feelings to contend with on
entering that inn once more.
</p>

<p>
The health of the architect was proposed by Mr. Harland,
and enthusiastically drunk by those present,
among whom the slight young girl, whose talent was
undeniable, was an interesting figure.
</p>

<p>
Mayne was among the guests, observant but aloof.
He was shut out completely from the confidence of
both those who were dear to him.  He could see that
the girl was wholly possessed and dominated by her
one absorbing interest.  He imagined that she had
accepted Lance simply because he asked her, and
because she was young and undeveloped, and did not
know exactly what she wanted; or because Lance
admired her, and the admiration of the young male will
always for a time influence the warm blood of the young
girl.  But Bert he found more inscrutable.  The man lived
within himself to a quite incredible extent.  But as far
as Mayne could see, he was not unhappy: certainly not
in despair.  He seemed to have accepted, without one
kick, the hardest stroke of Destiny.  In such submission,
to one who knew Bert, there was something ominous.
</p>

<p>
Mayne knew nothing of one electric moment in which
Bert had torn from Melicent's eyes three secrets.  First,
that she knew him; second, that she feared him; third,
that she was going to entrench herself against him.
</p>

<p>
These things lay unspoken in the man's dogged heart.
</p>

<p>
In the late afternoon, the Captain turned to his
architect, who had been saying good-bye to the Harland
party, and took out his watch.
</p>

<p>
"You have three quarters of an hour before your fly
comes to fetch you," he said, "and Mayne has taken the
Helstons to look at the church.  I want to show you
something, if you would stroll down the lane with me."
</p>

<p>
To refuse would have been ridiculous; but as they
went, she was acutely conscious that this was the first
time they had been alone together since the day she
had recognised him.
</p>

<p>
They were walking towards Lone Ash, and the
wonderful beauty of the May evening breathed incense
about them as they went.  Orchards everywhere made
the whole earth seem a-bloom.  A glory of distant gorse
blazed on the horizon line.
</p>

<p>
After a few moments Melicent grew nervous, and felt
she must speak.
</p>

<p>
"Is the first consignment of dressing-stone delivered?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Up at the station," he replied eagerly, as if the
question pleased him.  "We bring some down to-morrow;
it ought to be on the ground at ten o'clock.
I took a look at it to-day, and thought it was up to
sample; but I should like you to see it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity the journey from London is so long," she
said regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"The very point I want to raise," returned he, with
unconcern which was not overdone.  "I think I need
my architect on the spot, and I'm prepared to pay to
have her there.  Ah!" as they turned a corner and a
charming cottage faced them, "this is what I want to
show you.  How do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
She stopped short, with a certain glow of feature and
glint of the eye, which was characteristic.  As usual,
when very pleased, she did not speak.  He watched her
eyes as they dwelt on the rustic English beauty of the
place.
</p>

<p>
The white smother of cherry-blossom melted against
the mellow red tiles.  By the garden-gate a big Forsythia
bush bore a burden of honey-coloured flowers.  The
garden was a tangle of periwinkle, woodruff, and
forget-me-not, with the all-pervading sweetness of wallflower;
and the glowing coral of the ribes nestled against the
tumble-down porch.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a mass of lilac-bloom in a fortnight," said
the girl, hardly knowing she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to come in," Brooke told her.
</p>

<p>
The door was ajar.  It opened upon a kitchen,
beautifully clean and tidy, evidently for ornament, not
use.  Within was a tiny parlour, with gate-leg table,
grandfather's clock and oak dresser.
</p>

<p>
"This is what I would ask my architect to put up with
now and then, to save her a good deal of going to and
fro," said Brooke.  "I have taken it for three months,
to accommodate my visitors, as there is no room in the
inn."
</p>

<p>
Carried away by the sweetness of the place, she sat
down upon the window-seat.
</p>

<p>
"This is Arcady!" she said.
</p>

<p>
He leaned against the print valance of the mantel,
looking very large in the tiny place.
</p>

<p>
"Do you like it?  Would you like to stay here now
and again?"
</p>

<p>
She turned her little head, its outlines sungilt against
the light without, and looked at him; and she answered
like a child, accepting unconsciously the suggestion of
an older person.
</p>

<p>
"I like it very much.  It would be a great
convenience to be able to stay.  I am so anxious
about the house."
</p>

<p>
"If that is so, you shall wait here and talk to
Mrs. Barrett, and ask her to show you the upstairs rooms,
while I go and fetch the Helstons to look at it.  There
will just be time."
</p>

CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
THE FRIENDSHIP GROWS
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "A whole white world of revival awaits May's whisper a while,<br>
  Abides and exults in the bud as a soft hushed laugh in a smile.<br>
  As a maid's mouth, laughing with love and subdued for the love's<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sake, May<br>
  Shines, and withholds for a little the word she revives to say."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;A. C. SWINBURNE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For three weeks, Melicent came down to the cottage on
Tuesday and stayed till Friday.  The first twice Brenda
had accompanied her; but Pater grumbled, and the third
time she came alone.
</p>

<p>
She was growing bold.  Brooke's behaviour never
varied.  He was courteous and easy, but never
confidential.  He would come down the lane with his
dogs, whistling, and lean over the gate among the
lilacs until Melicent appeared from the cottage door,
and they went on to Lone Ash together.  His first
greeting always was:
</p>

<p>
"How are you?  Good news of Burmester, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
He was in great social request, and dined out most
nights, often hurrying away from the absorbing spectacle
of the rising walls of his home to lunch with some
neighbouring magnate.
</p>

<p>
During the third week, except for their morning chat
together, she scarcely saw him at all until Friday
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The week had been wet and cold, and she had been
tramping about in a mackintosh and gaiters; but to-day
was brilliantly fine, and she was lunching <i>al fresco</i>, up at
the works, being immensely interested in some fresh
boring operations then in progress in connection with
her beloved fish-pond.  She was sitting upon a pile of
dry planks, making a dessert of almonds and raisins, and
deep in a book, when she saw the Captain drive up.
He seldom brought the motor up to the works.  He
had his own cart now, and a fast cob; and a trim young
groom to look after them.
</p>

<p>
He sprang out, came up to where she sat, and began
asking eager questions about the boring.  They talked
shop for several minutes, he sitting among the planks a
little below her perch, bare-headed, and with his gaze
upon the long foundation-lines.
</p>

<p>
Then a short silence fell, while the exhilarating May
air sang about them.  Looking straight before him, he
said unconcernedly:
</p>

<p>
"Came to see if you cared for a drive this afternoon.
It's a jolly day, and I've got to go to Arnstock.  Care
to come?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated.  Why not?  She had evicted Mrs. Grundy
long ago, and on what other grounds could she
refuse?  Yet something within said, "Don't," so loudly
as to drown the voice of calm reason.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'd better not.  I'm waiting here to see
them begin to lay the damp course.  Thanks all the
same."
</p>

<p>
He looked at his watch.  Then turned to her with a
gleam in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"They quit work in an hour, so that reason won't do.
Don't you trust me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no notion what you mean," said Melicent,
instantly frozen.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "of course I know you despise
conventionalities or you would not be following your
present profession.  When a girl steps down into the
arena and joins the wrestling, one takes it for granted
that she doesn't mind what folks say.  So, if you refuse
to let me take you a drive, I have to conclude that your
objection is personal, don't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't consider it possible that I really
may not wish to take a drive this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"Seeing what the weather's been this week, and what
it is to-day, and the way you've been sticking to work, I
think it's unlikely," he said calmly.  He rose.  "Pity
you won't come," he added.  "They're enlarging
Arnstock Churchyard, and they've unearthed the head
of a Saxon cross."  Melicent sprang involuntarily to
her feet.  He looked at her steadily.  "Knot-work," he
said firmly.  "As clean-cut as if it had been carved last
week.  They have got several bits.  Harland thinks
they may find it all.  That's what I'm going to see."
</p>

<p>
She laughed a little uneasily.  "I don't believe I can
resist that," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Come along then," he replied coolly, picking up her
warm coat from the planks.  "There's Alfred to play
propriety, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you've ever been to Arnstock," he
said, as they bowled lightly along the firm high-road.
"You do nothing but stick to work.  It isn't good for
you."
</p>

<p>
"I have been to tea with the Harlands, and I am
going to dine there next week.  I don't know what
more you can suggest in the way of dissipation.  I'm
sorry if I am ridiculous about Lone Ash, but you must
consider the fascination of it.  My first house&mdash;my
dream!  To see it taking shape before my eyes!"
</p>

<p>
She gazed before her with eyes that saw visions, and
Hubert looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"I feel great scruples about monopolising you so
much," he remarked.  "Ought not all your energies
just now to be concentrated on your <i>trousseau</i>?"
</p>

<p>
He was in a position to see the full play of expression
in the face she sought to avert He marked the
instinctive repugnance, the effort at concealment, the
cold annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"Lancelot understands that I must first do what I
undertook to do," she said stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am actually postponing the wedding
arrangements?  This is serious.  My only excuse must
be that there was no one who had a prior claim when
you pledged yourself to me."
</p>

<p>
For just one moment she misunderstood&mdash;for one
second she was on the verge of self-betrayal.  It was
on her tongue to say: "I never pledged myself to you!"
when she saw the trap laid for her.  Was it intentional?
Swiftly she flashed a look at him.  No babe could have
been more innocent in expression.
</p>

<p>
"My private concerns will never be allowed to clash
with business arrangements," she said haughtily.
"What man would postpone, or throw up good work,
just because he was going to be married?"
</p>

<p>
"Marriage is a mere episode nowadays, isn't it?"
he said.  "Just a holiday experience.  The English
fashion of it wouldn't content me."
</p>

<p>
"Marriage is not a thing you can talk about in the
abstract," she said irritably.  "One marriage is not a
bit like another.  You can choose your own kind, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Can you?" he asked urgently, in the candid tones
of one seeking useful information.
</p>

<p>
There was a shadow of emphasis on the pronoun.
She made no reply, and he went on:
</p>

<p>
"People's circumstances are so different I can
imagine that <i>you</i> might face the idea of marriage as a
mere interlude, because your life is so full, and holds
so much else of love and fame and what not.  Now in
my case ... will you allow a lonely man the luxury of
talking about himself for five minutes?"
</p>

<p>
"I am interested," said Melicent, quite politely.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, here am I, alone in the world.  I can
hardly remember my mother.  I never had but one real
friend&mdash;a man.  I don't think I can remember a woman
speaking one solitary kind word to me until I turned
up in England with money.  Now do you see, that
friendless as I am, without human ties of kith or kin, what
seems to you just a convenient arrangement, is to me
the one possibility life offers? ... I wonder if you have
ever thought what it must be to live altogether without
intimacies, as I have done, for thirty years?"
</p>

<p>
There was a quiet, earnest simplicity in his voice
which disarmed her.  Suddenly she saw him in a new
light.  He was no longer the relentless pursuer, the man
who hunted down a girl as his desired quarry.  He was
a lonely, heart-hungry fellow, who had been starving for
kind words, thirsting for feminine sympathy.  Seeing
him in the light of what he had since become, she
revolted from the memory of her own hardness.  She
had been the only English girl&mdash;the only creature with
whom he felt affinity&mdash;in Slabbert's Poort.  Among all
the degradation and savagery of the place, he had
stretched out appealing hands to the one woman who
might have understood.  And she had never given him
one kind word!  He said he could not remember one!
</p>

<p>
Without her own volition she felt her heart assailed
with a rush of pity and tenderness wholly new in her
self-centred, balanced experience.  Without a word of
reproach, with an almost bald simplicity, this man had
opened the flood-gates of compassion.  He had done
more; made her ashamed of herself.  She felt her face
suffused with colour&mdash;she knew that her eyes swam
with tears.  The brilliant sun, facing them as they
drove westward, almost blinded her.  She felt she
must say something; but the effect of his words had
been so unexpected, so overwhelming, that she could
not control her voice at once.  At last, feeling that her
lack of response must seem unkind, she faltered out:
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I am so sorry for you.  I never guessed you
were so&mdash;lonely!"
</p>

<p>
And to her rage and fury, her eyes over-brimmed and
two tears&mdash;rare indeed with her&mdash;splashed down upon
the rug that covered her knees.
</p>

<p>
Hubert made some kind of an inarticulate exclamation,
and an abrupt movement, abruptly checked by
the consciousness of the neatly apparelled back of
Alfred, the groom, almost touching his own.  He
maintained complete silence for a long minute, then,
bending towards Melicent:
</p>

<p>
"Were those tears for me?" he asked, very low.
</p>

<p>
She had hastily found her handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I think so.  I can't quite explain; what you
said recalled something else ... and I suppose I'm
tired."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless," he replied, still below his breath, "I
have had, at least for a moment, the sympathy of a
woman.  I shan't forget that.  I hope you don't think
I am in the habit of puling and drivelling about my
lonely lot.  I don't know what impelled me to sentiment,
but I assure you it is all over now.  See, there is
Arnstock Church!  We will have tea at the inn, and
then the workmen will be gone home, and we can have
the churchyard to ourselves."
</p>

<p>
They pulled up at a little low inn, covered with
wisteria and honeysuckle.  As he helped her down, she
realised that her fear of him had suddenly disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Seated by a little table at an open window over-looking
a quaint garden, she poured out tea for him,
and enjoyed home-made bread, and honey from the row
of hives which stood before the hawthorn hedge.
</p>

<p>
They talked easily and naturally, like two between
whom a barrier has been swept away.  Hubert told her
of his search among his mother's papers, his discovery
there of the name of his grandfather's native village,
his coming to England, and his quest of what Lance
called his ancestral acres.
</p>

<p>
Tea over, they proceeded to the churchyard, and
spent a vivid half-hour with the fragments of the Saxon
cross and its knot-work.  Melicent was in a fever of
eagerness to discover runes, but there were none.
However, they found what was almost as good, a series of
grotesques down the sides of the shaft.
</p>

<p>
The workmen had turned up almost all the pieces,
and when Melicent suggested, in a moment of inspiration,
that the Captain should pay for its restoration and
erection in the churchyard, by way of inaugurating his
reign at Clunbury, he took up the idea with avidity.
</p>

<p>
They drove back almost in silence; but a silence so
full for both, that they hardly realised their lack of
words.
</p>

<p>
At the lilac-decked cottage gate, Hubert jumped out,
and as usual held his hands to help her down.  She had
just drawn off her leather gloves, and there seemed
something significant and wonderful in the warm
contact of their bare hands.  The light was not good.
That, or something else, caused her foot to slip on the
high step.
</p>

<p>
For just one moment she felt an instinctive tightening
of his grasp, and one arm went round her so swiftly that
all danger of a fall was over before recognised.  She
was set on the ground ... she felt dizzy, and almost
staggered when released.  For in that arresting instant,
his mouth had been close to her ear, and she thought
a sentence came to her&mdash;that he said, so low that she
could scarcely hear:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hadn't you better give in?</i>"
</p>

<p>
She had regained her poise, drawn herself away, her
eyes shot a bewildered glance at him in the twilight.
He did not look at her, but seemed in a tremendous
hurry to be off.  He had jumped back into the cart and
was spinning down the lane before she had time to
draw breath, or to ask herself if he had really said what
she thought she heard.
</p>

<p>
She stood there, listening to the brisk beat of the
horse's hoofs on the dry road, for quite a long time.
Not a twig stirred in a stillness which seemed almost
portentous.  The dampness and fragrance of earth and
growing things rose about her like incense.  In a
thicket not far distant, a nightingale began to bubble
and gurgle into song.
</p>

<p>
Had he said it?  If so, what did he mean?  To
what was she to give in?  To the influence which that
afternoon had softened, and as it were, dilated her
heart?  To the new kindness which she felt for him?
</p>

<p>
It must be illusion.  Would he have asked a question
of the kind and ridden away without an answer?  Was
it an inner voice that had spoken?  If so, what was the
purport?
</p>

<p>
Anger and self-will awoke.  Her understanding, her
emotions, her will were and should remain in her own
keeping.  What was the sensation she had experienced
a moment ago, with his arms about her?  She felt
herself blush scarlet in the darkness.
</p>

Next morning she went back to London.

CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
THE TREACHERY
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Doubt you if, in some such moment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she fixed me, she felt clearly<br>
  Ages past the soul existed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here an age 'tis resting merely,<br>
  And hence fleets again for ages,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the true end, sole and single,<br>
  It stops here for, is this love-way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some other soul to mingle?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  "Else it loses what it lived for,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eternally must lose it;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeper blisses (if you choose it);<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been lost here; doubt you whether<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine and her souls rushed together?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ROBERT BROWNING.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Melicent only came down to Clunbury for one day
the following week; and Mr. Helston was with her.
The week after, she came for two days, and brought
Brenda.
</p>

<p>
This was not the result of any scheme of self-defence;
it simply happened in the ordinary course
of events.
</p>

<p>
For she no longer disliked Hubert.  Her mental
attitude had changed.
</p>

<p>
The enlightenment which his simple and sparing
speech had brought to her had been a veritable shock.
She saw herself again as she had been at the time of
his early devotion&mdash;the despised Cinderella, the half-grown
slattern, the insolent, self-absorbed little upstart.
Her own dulness of perception and ingratitude began
to show themselves to her in a strong light.  She
marvelled at his constancy, and stood amazed at his
insight.  He had seen her, not as she was, but as she
might be.  It was she who had been blind.
</p>

<p>
So she thought of him: and yet, at the bottom of
her mind, lurked a mysterious reluctance to go down
to Lone Ash again.
</p>

<p>
She wrote to Lance more affectionately than she had
ever done.  She told him she meant to be less hard,
more unselfish, to do her best to respond to the
affection he lavished upon her.
</p>

<p>
Time was flowing swiftly past her.  In three weeks
he would be home!
</p>

<p>
And it was June.
</p>

<p>
At last Captain Brooke wrote to say that there was a
question in the builder's mind respecting an additional
support at a point where the thrust of the wall was
greater than had been reckoned for.  He added that
the builder and the engineer were quarrelling about the
Lee-Simmons man-holes.  Moreover, the weathered
tiles were beginning to arrive, and there was a question
raised as to the condition of some of them.  There was
no doubt that her presence was necessary, and finally
she went down, upon a day that focussed in its heart
all the tender glories of an English summer.
</p>

<p>
The lilacs were fading now, but pink may and golden
laburnum flaunted in beauty; and Melicent, as she
cycled up the lane from the station, caught the
intoxicating fragrance of syringa.
</p>

<p>
"What a garden this is!  I believe it holds a bit of
everything in the world that smells sweet!" she cried,
as she greeted Mrs. Barrett.  "It reminds me of the
garden in Solomon's Song.  How this sunshine does
make the spices flow out!"  As she spoke, she gathered
a tiny spray of waxen syringa and a cluster of double
pink may, like wee Banksia roses, and fastened them in
her white gown.  "After London, this is so wonderful!"
she sighed.
</p>

<p>
"You look pale, miss.  The fresh air'll set you up.
The Captain was round this morning to know if you'd
come.  He seemed that disappointed not to find you.
I expect now he'll think you're not coming down till
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Is he up at Lone Ash now, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe he will be, miss.  Tommy, have you heard
the Captain drive back, down the lane?"
</p>

<p>
No, Tommy had not; he was sure the Cap'n had not
returned.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have a glass of milk now, please, Mrs. Barrett,
and then go up and find him," said Melicent.
</p>

<p>
"There's been a gentleman had your rooms this
week-end," said Mrs. Barrett, as she provided
refreshment.  "Mr. Mayne, a clergyman.  They do say he's
to be made a bishop.  He was fine and took up with
the building, and as friendly as ever I see.  I'm sure we
oughter be grateful to the Lord for sending of the
Captain down here.  A godsend to this village he be.
There's Carter down the lane, talked of drowning
hisself, he did; wife and three childer, no work to be
had, nowhere to live if he got it.  Now he's to have
head gardener's place, and Captain's going to build him
a cottage, four rooms and a kitchen!  He just goes
about, does the Captain, and finds out truth about
everybody.  Nobody's going to get over him, not they!
Keeps his eyes skinned, and no mistake about it.  Been
into the bar of the Hearty Welcome night after night
since he's been staying there, and found out all he
wants to know about they chaps.  He's got the whip-hand
of the lot by now; knows twice as much about
'em as what vicar does; and it's my belief, he'll be the
best served master in this county."
</p>

<p>
Melicent drank her milk absently.  She wished, yet
dreaded to see Hubert again.  Her novel mood of
self-abasement craved humiliation.  Since realising
how unlovable her conduct had been, she was invaded
by unreasonable desires to let him know that she was
really not such a beast as she seemed.  A wish to tell
him that she knew who he was, and would like to be
friends, assailed her like a temptation, though she knew
that such confidences would be the very height and
apex of folly.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for it, she firmly told herself, as
she put on her shady hat and mounted her bicycle, but
to remain upon business terms.
</p>

<p>
It gave her a little shock of joy, as she neared the
gate leading to the Captain's property, to see the grey
walls high enough to be clearly discerned from the road.
</p>

<p>
She rode noiselessly over the pasture, dismounted at
the hill, wheeled her bicycle forward among the trees,
and propped it against the trunk of a big beech.
</p>

<p>
The workmen were gone.  She could see Hubert
sitting there, on the pile of planks where she had sat
last month.  How long ago that seemed!  How far she
had travelled since their drive together!
</p>

<p>
He did not appear to be doing anything but meditating.
His arms rested on his knees, his hands hung down
between; he was looking at the ground.  Melicent was
taken with a sudden conviction that it would be wise
to turn and run before he saw her.  She combated the
feeling with indignation.  She remembered how loath
she had been to go that drive.  And how glad she now
was that she went!  It had made so vast a difference
to her, she felt something as Gareth felt when he
unhorsed the dread Black Knight, and found the rosy
child within.
</p>

<p>
Why not go forward?
</p>

<p>
The alternative no longer remained: he looked up
and saw her.
</p>

<p>
She came towards him from among the trees, in her
white gown, wearing a look he had never seen upon her
face before in life, though he had dreamed of it now and
then.  Her eyes seemed to have grown larger, darker,
softer.  Her face was of that warm rose whiteness which
relieves itself so vividly and strangely against a white
dress.
</p>

<p>
He stood up; but absorbed in the picture she made,
he did not advance to greet her.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had not come," he said; and even to
say so much was an effort.
</p>

<p>
"I had things to do."  She smiled.  "Some of that
shopping you reminded me of the other day!  I came
by the later train."
</p>

<p>
He recollected himself.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you have good news of Burmester," he said
mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"The best," answered Melicent quietly.  "He will be
home in less than three weeks."
</p>

<p>
He had been staring at the grass, but on that he raised
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And when shall you be&mdash;married?"
</p>

<p>
"The day is not fixed; only that it will be at
Fransdale."  There was a pause, and to fill it she said:
"I hear Mr. Mayne has been here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I suppose you are going to his consecration
next week?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; he sent us tickets.  Do you know how
long he stays in England?  He ought to wait for
my wedding."
</p>

<p>
"So I told him," said Captain Brooke slowly,
balancing a long screw-driver with which he was playing
across one finger of his left hand.
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!&mdash;well, he said several things; but he didn't
mean me to repeat them, so don't ask me, please."
</p>

<p>
She gave an odd, excited laugh.  "I don't ask; I
order you to tell me."
</p>

<p>
He gazed upon her, so absorbed in his thoughts about
her, that the subject in hand faded out of sight.  She
could not meet his look.  Tossing her head, she turned
a little away.
</p>

<p>
"So you won't tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what?"
</p>

<p>
"What he said."
</p>

<p>
"What who said?"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke, what is the matter with you?  We
were talking of Mr. Mayne.  We had better leave off if
you are not attending, and go and look at those tiles."
</p>

<p>
"The more serious matter is the water," he said,
shaking off his preoccupation and sensibly relieved by
the change of subject.
</p>

<p>
He led the way from where they stood to a
pit four feet deep, with a stand-pipe projecting from
the newly-turned soil.  Kneeling down on the edge,
he bent over, and turned on the union tap, which had
been fixed for connection with a rubber hose.  The
girl gave a mortified exclamation:
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's dry!"
</p>

<p>
He acquiesced.
</p>

<p>
"That's where Shepherd's rage against the
Lee-Simmons engineer comes in, and why he wants to
wipe up the floor with him.  The supply was all
right the first two days, dribbled for two more; then
stopped.  The engineer says it is simply that Shepherd's
men have fixed the thing so carelessly that the pipe's
blocked down below.  I think I'll get the jointed rod
and probe it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my fish-pond, I thought I had secured you!"
said Melicent sadly.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have it, if there's water in Wiltshire," he
began; then stopping dead&mdash;"I mean, the thing must
be made to act somehow.  By the way, there's Alfred
with the cart.  I'll send him back for the rod; he can
bring it in a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Lend me your wrench, then, and I'll get the tap
right off," said the girl.
</p>

<p>
He handed her the tool she asked for, and went off
across the field to give his directions.
</p>

<p>
She jumped down into the muddy pit, and set herself
to unscrew the tap.  It was not very easy, but she
managed it at last; and then, with the thing in her
hand, remained in her crouching attitude, examining it
to see if there was any obstruction.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound like a deep sigh&mdash;a rush like
heavy rain&mdash;a jet of yellow water flew from the pipe,
hit the opposite side of the pit with great violence, and
before she knew what had happened, she was over her
ankles in water.  In a calmer moment, she would have
scaled the miry sides of the pit, regardless of
appearances; but she was not calm, and she lost her head.
The unexpected nature of the thing scared her&mdash;she
had the idea that if once she let the pit fill, they would
be unable to stop the flow; and so, with a spring, she
flung herself upon the pipe, clasping her two hands
rigidly about it, and stanching the most part of the
rush.  But the strength of the pulsing water was great,
her footing slimy, her purchase feeble.  Raising her
voice, regardless of all but the emergency, she cried
aloud:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bert!  Bert!  Bert!</i>  Quick!"
</p>

<p>
He had only just dismissed Alfred on his errand, and
was hurrying back, when that sound smote his ear.  He
broke into a laugh of pure joy as he heard it, but he
ran with all his might.
</p>

<p>
The moment he got to the brink of the pit, he saw
what was happening; and he, too, lost his head.  Instead
of calling to her to let go, and holding down his hands
to draw her up, at the expense of a drenching, he forthwith
sprang down, placed himself beside her, and locked
his hands over hers.
</p>

<p>
The fact of his doing this bereft her of all power
of speech.
</p>

<p>
She was totally unconscious of having called him by
name; she did not know the reason of his kindled,
glowing look.  Neither, for a few long-drawn seconds,
considered what was to be done.  They simply stood
there, so acutely conscious of each other that nothing
else in all the universe seemed real.
</p>

<p>
She was the first to recall her scattered wits.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is too ridiculous," she said faintly.  "We
can't hold on!  We can't hold on!"
</p>

<p>
"Just long enough for Alfred to get back," he
whispered.  "He can't be ten minutes.  He can have
the thing ready to screw on, and save you a deluge&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" she uttered feebly.  "We can't hold
on here for ten minutes!  We can't, simply."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we could hold on for ever," he jerked out,
his voice sunk to a note that made her quail.
</p>

<p>
The force in his hands seemed to be communicating
itself to her.  She was dominated, absorbed, had
forgotten everything but him.  He never spoke, but she
became aware that he wished her to look at him.  She
tore away her gaze from the sight of their gripped hands,
raised her head, searched his face with pleading eyes.
</p>

<p>
Their looks met and mingled.
</p>

<p>
A dull beat was hammering through her senses.  Was
it his heart or hers, or the pulse of Time itself?
</p>

<p>
Their faces drew nearer, nearer to each other.
</p>

<p>
Something was going to happen&mdash;something that
should explain all life and blaze the answer to every
secret ... that was the thought she had as their lips
met.
</p>

<p>
Was it he who bent to her, or was the impulse that
drew them mutual?
</p>

<p>
The blinding sweetness of that kiss was unmarred
by any thought of treachery.  The world and Lance
with it, had simply gone out in the ecstasy of the
light that flooded her.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was over.  The world that had stood at gaze
like Joshua's moon on Ajalon, swung on once more
her dance among the stars.
</p>

<p>
Melicent stood there, in the fair June evening, at
the side of the man who had kissed her.  The wind
came softly over meadows deep in buttercups, and
bent the white lacy sprays of delicate wild parsley
which fringed them.  High in the blue sky the lark
stormed heaven's gate with song.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!" she cried, with a stifled sob.  "I
must go!  Don't you see that I must?"
</p>

<p>
It was a moment before he replied; but when he
did, his voice was perfectly composed and cool.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as you feel the pressure of my hands relax,
slip yours downwards," he said.
</p>

<p>
A moment later she was free.
</p>

<p>
"There!  Oh, why couldn't you do that before?"
she cried passionately, as she made a frantic onslaught
upon the crumbling side of the pit.
</p>

<p>
She was up and away in a minute, her white frock
soaked, her feet caked in pale yellow mud.  She ran across
the grass, never stopping to look behind, and met the
bewildered Alfred just at the edge of the plantation.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry to the Captain," she gasped.  "The water has
started to run and he can't stop it.  I must go home
and change!"
</p>

<p>
Her throat was so dry she could hardly speak.  In
feverish, stumbling haste she mounted her bicycle, and
rode down the bumpy grass slope at a dangerous pace.
Mercifully the gate into the lane stood wide, and she
was through it and back at the cottage in a couple
of minutes.
</p>

<p>
Alfred found his master up to the knees in what
looked like weak tea with cream in it.  Between them
they managed to re-fix the tap, connect the long hose,
and set the liquid flowing into Melicent's fish-pond.
</p>

<p>
Emerging from the pit, the Captain looked at his
legs&mdash;he was wearing a cool, summer suit of light grey
flannel.
</p>

<p>
"The wash-tub, Alfred, is the place for me," he said
resignedly.
</p>

<p>
"Yessir!" said Alfred, who had prudently removed
his own smart leg-wear before venturing to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
"Joseph was better off than I am, Alfred.  His pit
was dry&mdash;there was no water in it."
</p>

<p>
"Yessir!  Miss Lutwyche, she was drenched, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I hope she won't take cold," said the Captain, with
polite solicitude; "but fortunately the day is warm.
Get on your boots, Alfred.  I'll let this thing run all
night, and perhaps there'll be something to show for it
in the morning.  There must have been something in the
pipe, and the force of the water dislodged it, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
Melicent, lying upon her bed with hidden face, heard
the cart go past the cottage.  The beat of the hoofs
was not interrupted; they passed by without stopping;
and the tension of her strained nerves relaxed.

THE REPUDIATION

  "Escape me?<br>
  Never&mdash;<br>
  Beloved!<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The delicate veil of sapphire which June calls night was
drawn across the splendour of the sky; and it was like
the device of a beauty who wears a transparent gauze to
enhance the glitter of her diamonds.
</p>

<p>
In the north still lingered a supernal glow, the hint of
the day that has no night.
</p>

<p>
The fragrance of unseen cottage gardens was all
about Hubert as he walked slowly up the lane from the
inn.  There was no moon.  The glimmer of starshine
made mysterious radiance, yet left a soft, velvet dusk,
without the clean-cut lights and shades of moonlight.
</p>

<p>
He had bathed, changed, dined.  Now he was coming
to ascertain the result of his daring experiment.  Had he
succeeded, as he hoped, in showing Melicent her own
heart?
</p>

<p>
He had no remorse.  The thing was necessary; it
had to be done.  Could he stand by and see a proud
girl wreck three lives?
</p>

<p>
It was very dark among the lilacs by the cottage gate.
Peering through the thick boughs, he started; for there
was no lamplight, either in the parlour or the room
above it.  And he believed that she had fled from him.
</p>

<p>
This gave a jolt to the pleasing elation of his spirits.
Walking on the grass, he approached the open door
without noise.  Then he halted.
</p>

<p>
The casements of the parlour were wide open to the
summer night.  On the window-sill lay a girl's abased
head, the fair hair just touched by the star-glimmer, the
face hidden in her arms.
</p>

<p>
She lay very still, and was apparently not weeping.
He went up to her, resisting with firmness his great
desire to lay his hand upon her hair.  For the first
time in years he spoke the name that stood for all his
ambitions.
</p>

<p>
"Millie," he said softly.
</p>

<p>
She sat up quickly.  He hardly knew what expression
he had expected to see; but the indignation of her eyes
was a surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I wonder how you dare come near me!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"I won't come near you.  I'll stay outside here," he
said hastily, with a bewildered sense of having lost the
thread of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"You certainly won't come in at my invitation."
</p>

<p>
"No, of course," he said meekly, his head fairly
spinning with wonder; "but I thought you would see
I had to come and beg your pardon."
</p>

<p>
She stood up, withdrawing herself into the room, as
if she meant to escape.
</p>

<p>
"There are things that are unpardonable," she said
coldly.
</p>

<p>
He contemplated this idea.  "Do you mean that you
never can forgive me?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I mean that I never can forgive myself,"
she said chokingly.  "You&mdash;you have humbled my
pride to the dust.  Lance ... trusts me, and I
have ... How am I to face him?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you mean to stick to that&mdash;to go on with your
engagement&mdash;to marry Lancelot&mdash;in spite of what
happened to-day?" he asked hastily.
</p>

<p>
She stood up straight in a long, loose, pale-coloured
gown, half lost, half seen in the faint light.  The glint
of the stars swam in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"May I ask what else you expected?"
</p>

<p>
He was at a loss.  Ready enough had he been to
console her, to tell her that Fate was too strong for her,
to urge her to correct her mistake before it was too late.
Her present attitude stunned him, and bereft him of
words.  The dashing of the high hopes with which he
had come bred in him a sudden sense of being wronged.
</p>

<p>
"Millie," he expostulated, "do you know what you
said&mdash;up there when the water rushed out upon you?
You called out: '<i>Bert!  Bert!</i>'"
</p>

<p>
There was silence.  He saw her start.
</p>

<p>
"Did I say that?" she said slowly.  "Then it is I
who have betrayed myself, and you&mdash;are not so much
to blame as I thought.  I can believe that it excited
you a little to find that I knew you, and made you
think of old times."  She hesitated, seeming at a loss
what to say or do; her embarrassment was obvious,
her distress manifest.  Then, with sudden determination,
she came near the window again.  "If that is true, I
suppose I must forgive you," she said stiffly, "and we
must both forget a mad moment."
</p>

<p>
He could hardly believe his ears.  "Is that all you
have to say?" he demanded harshly.
</p>

<p>
"The less we either of us say the better, surely,
concerning such an affair."
</p>

<p>
The man drew in his breath sharply.  "After all that
has come and gone?" he panted.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke, for a moment this afternoon I
allowed myself and you to forget that I am engaged
to your friend.  I must remind you of it now."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to God that I had let him drown in the
drift!" he flung out.  "Or that I had drowned
myself&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish to be hard or unkind, but I cannot
listen to you.  I am going to close the window."
</p>

<p>
He inserted his shoulder, so that she could not close
it.  The expression of his eyes was such that she dare
not face him.
</p>

<p>
"Answer me one question," he commanded brusquely.
There was a growl in his voice that she knew of old as
a storm-signal.  "I have a right to ask it, and you
ought to answer&mdash;you <i>shall</i> answer!  When I kissed
you to-day ... <i>was it against your will?</i>"
</p>

<p>
Her expression made him feel as if he had slashed
her across the face.  Had she accepted defeat in that
moment&mdash;said anything to appease the man's mounting
wrath&mdash;he might have kept his head.  But pain or
insult had never the effect of softening Melicent, but
only of stiffening her.  His taunt stung her to real
anger, and, in the midst of her stifled consciousness
that she was fighting a losing battle, she clutched at
her indignation as at a blade with which she might
wound.  She had moved towards the door with the
intention of escape, but now she returned to the
window.
</p>

<p>
"You think you have the right to ask me that?" she
said, with the same ruthless arrogance that she might
have used to him in Africa.  "You say that to me&mdash;you,
who hope to turn into something that people may take
for an English gentleman! ... You did that this
afternoon to get a hold over me!  I know your threat!
You needn't say it!  You mean that, if I don't tell
Lance, you will! ... And you suppose I care if you
do, or what you do, or anything about you...!"
</p>

<p>
Before she had got so far, Bert had flung his leg
over the sill and vaulted lightly into the room.  He
came quite close to her, but spoke quietly, under his
breath, with an air of desperately holding himself in.
</p>

<p>
"All right!" he said.  "You say you don't care, do
you?  Well, then, if you say so, I say you lie!  You
lie, do you hear me?"
</p>

<p>
"You had better go away before you grow
unpardonable," said the girl coldly.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go when I've said what I'm going to say, and
not before.  I'm going to tell you the cold truth here
and now.  The Brooke farce is played out, we know
each other, and you shall hear what I have to say!
<i>You&mdash;kissed&mdash;me</i> to-day!&mdash;great God! do you suppose
I don't <i>know</i> that you did?&mdash;and you did it because&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Slight things decide momentous issues.  Even then
an appeal, the smallest sign of surrender on the girl's
part, would have brought him crouching to her feet.
But she flung back her head, and looked him in the eyes
to show how little she feared him; and she laughed.
</p>

<p>
That let loose the tempest.  All in a moment he
broke off his husky, difficult words.  All in a moment
he had her by the waist, crushing her to him as if
holding her against an army.  There was no love in the
fierce hold, only the determination that she should hear
the cruel words that he spoke into her ear:
</p>

<p>
"Because you love me!  Because you love me!
Because you're mine&mdash;mine&mdash;mine!"
</p>

<p>
She disdained to struggle, as she disdained to plead.
She made no effort to fling him off.  Her silent, passive
contempt brought him to himself in a flash.
</p>

<p>
The girl who, that golden afternoon had yielded to
his spell, had weakened, had been as it were his to take,
now lay like a lifeless thing in his ungentle hold.  He
realised what he had done.
</p>

<p>
When he let her go, she did, by an effort, stand alone.
Her laugh of scorn was quenched.  She lifted one hand
to hide the quivering of her mouth, but did not move
at once, perhaps because she feared to fall.  He turned
away from the still, silent, accusing figure with a kind of
roar of helpless strength, of baffled will.
</p>

<p>
"The same, the same as ever," he said.  "The
woman's way!  To make me feel a great, rough brute,
when all the time it's you that are cruel.  Yes!  As
cruel as a fiend."
</p>

<p>
To and fro he paced, to and fro upon the floor; then,
with sense of defeat in overwhelming bitterness, got to
his knees at her feet.
</p>

<p>
He knew that his fatal moment of uncontrolled
temper had undone all that the past weeks had gained
so painfully and slowly.  Beneath his shame was an
undercurrent of conviction that he was right and she
wrong.  But what was right or justice in face of
Melicent's inflexibility?
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry.  I'm a brute.  But it's your fault.  You
know what you can do with me," he said chokingly.
</p>

<p>
"Get up!" said her exhausted voice.  "Get up, do!
Go away.  You see you are ... impossible.  I thought
you had improved, but you see it's all ... just as bad
as ever."
</p>

<p>
"Millie!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't touch me."
</p>

<p>
"You know I am not such a hound as to think I
have any hold ... or to use it, if I had?"
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter to me?"  She moved: he
held a fold of her gown.  "Are you going to detain
me?" she asked.  "Because if so, I shall call Mrs. Barrett.
This is not love&mdash;oh, no, nor anything like it;
it's simply your fixed determination to have your own
way.  I've always known it, all these years&mdash;that you
were not beaten, that you meant to try again.  Not for
love of me, but simply because to conquer me is your
fixed idea.  And this afternoon you thought you had
succeeded.  Well, you haven't, that's all."
</p>

<p>
He got to his feet, utterly humbled, reduced to abject
pleading:
</p>

<p>
"Millie, see me again!  Don't let it end here!  I've
lost my head, and don't know what I am saying.  Give
me a chance to talk things out&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never, never, never!" she shuddered, making for
the door.  There she turned upon him.  "You are a
savage!  If you knew how I hate savagery!  You are
a Boer!  If you knew how I hate the Boers!  I'll
marry a man who knows how to treat a woman, not one
whose civilisation is only skin-deep."  He took two
maddened strides towards her.  "Has that hurt you?
Very well, then, you can kill me, you know.  I wonder
you don't."
</p>

<p>
He passed a hand over his hair like one pushing a
veil from his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you why I don't," he said, in tones that
rapped out sharp as a rapier thrust.  "It's because
you're not worth it."
</p>

<p>
Almost before he had spoken, he had turned about,
sprung from the window, and disappeared.  The
starshine glimmered in the silent room where a moment
ago had been such storm and stress.
</p>

<p>
Melicent stood alone, in possession of the field.  The
suddenness of the withdrawal of the besieging forces
took her breath.  The Parthian shot, fired in the
moment of flight, reached her heart and quivered there.
</p>

<p>
She gave a strangled low cry, as if physically hurt.
</p>

<p>
At last, it seemed, the long struggle was over.  Not
because Bert realised that she was out of reach, but
because suddenly he had awoke from his dream to find
her not worth fighting for.
</p>

<p>
She told herself that, whatever the means, the thing
was done, and finally done now.  There would be no
more vehement assaults for her to dread.
</p>

<p>
Yet something unpleasantly like remorse was gnawing
at her heart.  She knew she had said things she did
not mean; in the heat of battle she had caught up
every missile....
</p>

<p>
Well, now it was over.  Silence and solitude were
profound.  The air which had vibrated to Bert's rage
and Bert's repentance was so still that the nightingale's
song sounded too loud in her ears.
</p>

<p>
"All over!" she said aloud; and the words sounded
strange and horrible.
</p>

<p>
"All over!" She crept upstairs to a sleepless night;
but this of late had been no rare thing with her.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In the early morning she went away to London,
choosing a route to the station which should not take
her past the inn.
</p>

<p>
And for weeks the grey walls of Lone Ash rose
higher in their dignified beauty, unseen by the eyes
of her for whom they were being raised, and whose
genius had called them into being.

CHAPTER XXXII
<br><br>
THE FRANSDALE SPORTS
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Embrace me then, ye hills, and close me in;<br>
  Now in the dear and open day I feel<br>
  Your guardianship; I take it to my heart;<br>
  'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;WORDSWORTH (The Recluse).<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The wedding-day was fixed, and Melicent lived in an
atmosphere of wedding presents and dressmakers.
</p>

<p>
Since her <i>fiancé's</i> return she had altered noticeably,
both in appearance and manner.  She was paler than
usual, large-eyed and languid; and she had grown
strangely gentle and yielding.  She deferred to Lancelot
in everything; and since two people cannot possibly
continue to kneel at each other's feet, and as Melicent
persistently adopted the lowly posture formerly
monopolised by her lover, he had, as a result, grown the least
bit dictatorial.
</p>

<p>
Theoretically, of course, the change pleased him;
but as a matter of fact, he had found his lady-love
more interesting when she was remote and prickly.
Her new meekness was purely passive; it did not
make her more demonstrative.  She submitted to be
caressed, but it was always obvious that it was mere
submission.
</p>

<p>
Brenda was very unhappy about her.  She was sure
that she was suffering mentally.  She knew she did not
sleep.  However, girls just before marriage are often
restless and unsettled, and there was nothing which she
could definitely take notice of.
</p>

<p>
At the end of July the Fransdale Sports took place,
an annual event of the highest local importance.  They
were held in a meadow near the head of the Dale, not
far below the Vicarage.  The meadow sloped violently,
but the fact was accepted by the natives as part of
an inexorable law of Nature.  All fields sloped; you
might as well quarrel with the grass for being green.
</p>

<p>
From early morning the little heathery tracks leading
down from the Riggs were black with a crawling line of
folks, descending Indian file by devious ways to the
scene of action.  Traps of all kinds, crowded with
passengers, began to arrive, and to distribute themselves
in all the neighbouring stable-yards, which were
soon filled to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
Streams of fine plough-horses, yearlings, hunters
and little fluffy foals, moved slowly along various radii
to the centre.  On the ground, the chief farmers' wives
were preparing a "ham tea" of vast proportions in a
large tent.
</p>

<p>
As the day wore on, the whole scene was alive with
colour.  Exhibits of butter, eggs, vegetables and fruit,
were being solemnly appraised by business-like judges.
There was a cackle of fowls, a cooing of doves, the
outraged cries of lordly rams tethered to stakes and with
coloured ribbons round their horns.
</p>

<p>
And the band!  One of the visitors remarked that it
was worth coming far, if only to see that band!
</p>

<p>
The musicians sat upon boards in the large hay-cart
in which they had been conveyed to the festal scene,
and from which the horses had been removed.  Their
broad and solid backs, in every hue of weather-stained
fustian, formed a study for the eye of the humorously
inclined.
</p>

<p>
Then, of course, there were cocoa-nut shies and gingerbread
stalls, and a wheel of fortune.  For this one day in
the year the austere solitude of the moorland was broken
through, and Fransdale was actually noisy and crowded.
</p>

<p>
Among the throng, which grew thicker as the day
wore into afternoon, was a sprinkling of gentry,
conspicuous among whom were the Burmesters.  Sir Joseph
took a genuine interest in all the exhibits, and gave
many valuable prizes.  There was naturally great interest
among all the natives over Lancelot's engagement.
Melicent was a most popular person, and glances of
affectionate admiration followed her to-day.
</p>

<p>
She wore a white lace gown, with La France roses, and
her white sunshade was lined with rose colour.  Brenda
thought she had never seen her look so pretty, nor so sad.
</p>

<p>
"The Ayres' party are here," said Lance, strolling up
to where his mother stood, with Mrs. Helston and
Melicent, watching the first heats of a race run off.
"They've brought their tame crowd of convalescents
with them."
</p>

<p>
"Did you know," said Lady Burmester, "that the
Ayres' offered their house for a Convalescent Home for
wounded officers?  That will arouse enthusiasm, won't
it, Lance?  The people will cheer, if they know there
are African heroes about."
</p>

<p>
"They exhausted their enthusiasm when Lance came
home," smiled Brenda.  "What a pity Captain Brooke
is not here, then we should have all the African
contingent."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Lance, "I forgot to tell you, Mrs. Helston,
I have at last persuaded the obstinate old
beggar to leave his beloved house to build itself for a
few weeks, and to come up here for a bit of rest."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well done!" said Brenda, with animation.  "I
should have been so sorry for him not to have been at
the wedding."
</p>

<p>
"He won't promise that, even now.  You know, I
wanted him to be best man.  He says weddings are not
at all in his line.  But when we get him here, perhaps
you and Melicent can persuade him."
</p>

<p>
"He ought to be here pretty soon," said Lady
Burmester.  "He's coming in his motor, by road all
the way, I believe, and he promised to try and arrive
in time for the sports.  I told him they were a sight he
ought not to miss."
</p>

<p>
Melicent was possessed by a most remarkable sensation,
as if she were drowning.  Fortunately, for a few
minutes nobody noticed her; and just as the waters
were about to close over her head, they began to recede
again, and she drew a deep breath and made a vehement
effort to collect her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
But it was not possible.  He was coming.  Why,
why, in wonder's name, had he changed his plainly
expressed intention of keeping away?
</p>

<p>
She felt sure something must have happened to cause
him to reconsider his decision.  Had he come to the
conclusion that it was right that Lance should know
their story&mdash;hers and his?  Had he resolved to tell it?
</p>

<p>
If so, they must have another tussle, he and she; for
somehow she felt sure that he would do nothing without
giving her fair warning.
</p>

<p>
Every nerve in her quivered at the thought of seeing
him.  The few short words in which he had expressed
his newly-born contempt said themselves over and over
in her mind continually.  How would he look?  What
should she say?  What would happen?
</p>

<p>
"They're judging the foals.  Such funny little rats!
Come and see them run round," said Lance's voice, close
to her.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him almost pitifully, as if searching
his face for visible assurance of love.  He was not
looking at her, nor thinking much of her apparently.
His visit to Russia had been a pleasant experience for
a clever young fellow&mdash;he had had his fill of flattery
and attention from the English <i>coterie</i> at St. Petersburg.
He was very fond of Millie, but the idea did cross his
mind now and then that she hardly seemed conscious
enough of the really fine match she was making.
To-day, his attention was by no means hers.  It was
all concentrated upon the live stock.
</p>

<p>
She crossed the grass at his side, and stood by the
rope enclosure, among the friendly faces of the
Dalesmen.  There was Alfred Dow, still unmarried, handsome
as ever, if more solid; by his side, talking to him, the
demure figure of her cousin Barbara.  So even the
Vicarage was beginning to march with the times!
There was the farmer who was reckoned the best judge
of horse-flesh in the horse-loving shire, and who might
have served as a model for the typical John Bull, as he
stood in his gaiters and beaver hat, watching the paces
of the candidates.  Melicent was watching them too,
with real interest, when it seemed to her as though a
touch were laid on her heart.  Without raising her eyes,
she knew who had drawn near.  She shivered as she
turned, and saw the Captain waiting to be greeted.
</p>

<p>
She said, "How do you do," without daring to meet
his eyes; yet she longed to know how they stood, and
on what terms this man was once again at her side.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O, come ye in peace or come ye in war,<br>
  Or to dance at my bridal, thou young Lochinvar?"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As once before, at Lone Ash, she became sensible
that he wished her to look at him.  She knew he must
read the signs of confusion on her face.  The news of
his coming had been too recent for her to have recovered
from it.  But she could not lift her eyes.  Lance's
cheerful greetings more than covered her silence; he was
sincerely glad to see his friend.  After a minute's chat,
however, he was called away.  He was much in request
that day, and had to go off with his father and judge
rams, deputing Melicent to "show Brooke round."
</p>

<p>
Alone with Hubert, her courage turned to water.
For a long minute they two stood there, unnoticed in
the crowd, holding their breath, dizzy, overwhelmed by
the mere fact of each other's presence.
</p>

<p>
He spoke at last.  "You're not looking at all well,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
To which she naturally replied in a hurry:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am particularly well, thanks, only a little tired
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"How do you think I look?" he asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
She dared not refuse the challenge.  Her eyes, when
she lifted them, held a piteous appeal.
</p>

<p>
But it was relief of which she was sensible as she met
his gaze.  It was kind and gentle.  He looked ill; so ill
that she wondered that Lance had not cried out upon
him.  He was like a man who has passed through some
shattering experience, she thought.  There were dark
marks below his eyes, he had lost flesh, and he was
pale, though so tanned that this was not obvious.  But
in his face was no shadow of the contempt she had feared
to see, and had winced from the thought of.
</p>

<p>
In her relief she smiled up at him wistfully, as a child
smiles at his mother, to make sure she is no longer
displeased.  When he smiled in answer, it was like sunshine
breaking out over a cloudy landscape.  It brought all
her heart to her lips, it made her inclined to say:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I must tell you my doubts and fears, and how I
have tortured myself since last I saw you!"
</p>

<p>
The words were trembling on her tongue.  In blind
terror of self-betrayal, she said the first safe thing that
came into her head; an inquiry after the progress at
Lone Ash.
</p>

<p>
"They are roofing it," he said.  "The roof goes on
this week."
</p>

<p>
She coloured with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do tell me what the effect is!  Do tell me how
it looks from the road below the gate!"
</p>

<p>
"It is beautiful!" he answered quietly.  "It grips me
afresh every time I see it.  Mayne, too, admires it
immensely.  Did you know I have had Mayne staying
with me for the past month?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; but I am glad to hear it," she cried.
"He was so interested in the house; and then, he is
quite an authority on gardens, isn't he?  You must
have found him a great help."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hubert absently.  "That's very true; he
has been a great help."
</p>

<p>
She sent a sidelong glance at him, and noted afresh
the marked change in his expression.  There was a look
upon the mouth that went to her heart in an indescribable
way.  It made her long to beg his pardon for the
things she had said to him that night.  The indefensibility
of her own conduct throughout smote upon her in quite
a new way.  Never before in all her life had she felt the
salutary self-reproach which now reddened her cheek,
tied her tongue, and seemed to leave her helpless before
him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she thought, "if he knew how much stronger
he is when he looks like that than when he is in one
of those awful rages."
</p>

<p>
He was speaking, and she collected herself with a
tremendous effort to listen.
</p>

<p>
"The effect of those middle windows, with the
transoms, which we had such doubt about, is awfully
good, to my thinking.  It only needs one thing."
</p>

<p>
"One thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Which I must consult you about.  I have come
here on purpose to talk of it I feel, perhaps, as if my
presence here may&mdash;to you&mdash;want a little explaining.
I have come because I thought I ought to.  When can
you give me a few minutes?"
</p>

<p>
It was true then: there had, as she guessed, been a
specific reason for his appearance.  Strangely enough,
she had never thought that it would be anything in
connection with Lone Ash.  Yet what more natural?
</p>

<p>
She looked alarmed.  "Is it important?"
</p>

<p>
"Very."
</p>

<p>
"You had better come over to Glen Royd to-morrow
morning.  I do hope it's not&mdash;any mistake I've made?"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm afraid that's just what it is.  But I don't
think it's irretrievable."
</p>

<p>
She was filled with consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't tell me it's structural!  We managed that
thrust of the wall on the north so splendidly with the
buttress."
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing structural," said Hubert.
</p>

<p>
They had moved away, talking together, from the
foals' enclosure, and were crossing the grass slowly, not
knowing whither they went.  Sybil Ayres approached
them, with two or three gentlemen, some of her military
convalescents.  She bowed to Melicent, whom she
cordially disliked, and was passing on, when one of her
companions cried:
</p>

<p>
"Why, surely that must be Miss Lutwyche!  How
d'ye do?  Didn't expect to see me here, did you?"
</p>

<p>
And Melicent was looking into the humorous, relentless
hatchet face of Amurrica.  His eye wandered over
her, noting every detail of her appearance and costume;
from her to her companion; and Melicent, with her
faculties sharpened by the emergency, saw with delight
that he did not recognise Bert.  Her expression did not
change.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you are mistaken," she said politely.
"I do not think we are acquainted."
</p>

<p>
"I'm making no mistakes.  My name's Otis.
'Amurrica' they used to call me in Slabbert's Poort,
as I've been explainin' to these ladies.  You're Millie
Lutwyche, ain't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am.  I remember, there was someone of your
name in the place.  But I do not remember that we
were ever acquainted.  I did not know any of the
diamond miners."
</p>

<p>
"I'm a diamond major now," cried Amurrica, with an
unpleasant laugh.  "Look here, Miss Lutwyche, we
shall be obliged to refresh your memory a little.  D'you
remember your father's funeral?  I was there."
</p>

<p>
"The whole town was there," said Millie, with
indifference.  Then, with an air of stopping the
conversation, she said to Miss Ayres: "Have you been in
the tents?  Is it worth while taking Captain Brooke to
see the fruit?"
</p>

<p>
Then, receiving a dubious answer, she inclined her
head in leave-taking, and walked away.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they were out of earshot, she looked
up at Hubert with an altered expression&mdash;a look of
comradeship&mdash;her late nervousness chased away.
</p>

<p>
"You see!  He didn't know you a bit!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," he answered.  "Just as big a beast as ever!
But do you mind my saying I think it was unwise to cut
him?  You've made him savage, and he may be rude."
</p>

<p>
"Let him," said Millie contemptuously.  "It is quite
true that I never knew him.  You know, I never would
speak to him.  How could he be rude?"
</p>

<p>
"He might say things about you&mdash;to other people."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he can't say anything I'm ashamed of," said
Millie coolly.
</p>

<p>
"You always did despise your enemies."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I haven't got any enemies now," was the
careless answer.
</p>

<p>
"God grant it!" he replied, thinking of things said to
him by Mrs. Cooper and her daughters one day when
he went to tennis at the Vicarage.

CHAPTER XXXIII

CALUMNY

<p class="poem2">
  I?  What I answered?  As I live<br>
  I never fancied such a thing<br>
  As answer possible to give.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;COUNT GISMOND.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Lancelot, returning from what he called distinguishing
between the rams and the he-goats, was intercepted by
Sybil Ayres.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Burmester, it is so interesting!  Here is a
gentleman who knows all about Miss Lutwyche!  Not
only that, but what do you think?  Her brother is his
servant!"
</p>

<p>
Lance stared blankly.
</p>

<p>
"Some mistake, Miss Ayres," he said pleasantly.
"Miss Lutwyche has no brother."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I'm tellin' lies, you can easily prove it, you
know," said Amurrica jocosely.  "The young lady's got
a short memory, but I daresay it can be refreshed."
</p>

<p>
"Do let me introduce Major Otis," said Sybil.  "He
is so interested to meet Miss Lutwyche's <i>fiancé</i>."
</p>

<p>
Otis took Lance by the hand, and shook it
impressively.
</p>

<p>
"I'm proud to meet a man of generosity and insight&mdash;I
say, of generosity and insight," said he solemnly.
"Insight to see that the gal's real grit, in spite of her
family; and generosity to overlook the things in her
past that are better not talked about."
</p>

<p>
"Look here!" said Lance, in a fury.  "I don't know
whether this is the latest variety of American humour,
but whatever it is, it's deuced bad form, and you'll find
you had better keep your head shut in England.
Kindly choose some other subject of conversation
than Miss Lutwyche, unless you want me to punch
your head."
</p>

<p>
"You could easily do that," said Otis pensively.
"I'm in quite the early stages of my convalescence.
However, there's no need.  Of course I withdraw all I
said.  Naturally, I thought you must know all about&mdash;well,
well!  Keep your hair on!  Sorry I spoke.  Can't
say more than that, can I?  Only this one thing I must
say.  My boy, Arnie Lutwyche, has lived in hopes of
finding his sister when he got to England.  Are you
goin' to prevent his speakin' to her?"
</p>

<p>
"There's some absurd error," said Lance, in a rage.
"I tell you Miss Lutwyche has no brothers.  I also
warn you, Major Otis, that there are libel laws in
England."
</p>

<p>
He raised his hat and hurried off, afraid to trust
himself.
</p>

<p>
Just as he departed, Madeline and Theo, who had
been for a long time hanging around, in hopes of being
introduced to some officers, ventured to come up, and
found themselves welcomed by Miss Ayres with quite
unwonted cordiality.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do come here!  Miss Lutwyche is your cousin,
isn't she?" she cried.  "You must be introduced to an
old friend of hers!"
</p>

<p>
The girls listened spellbound to the piquant story of
the presence in England of a Boer boy who was Millie's
brother.  "A regular, sulky Boer," giggled Sybil, "who
only speaks very broken English."
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Madeline, "then I expect the Major
could tell us all about Millie before she came to
England&mdash;what we have always wanted to know&mdash;how
she got her arm broken, and so on."
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you that, certainly.  She broke her arm
scrambling out through a skylight to meet her lover,
when her stepmother had locked her in."
</p>

<p>
"That we can easily believe," cried Theo.  "Father
sent her away from the Vicarage for that very same
thing&mdash;getting out of her bedroom window at night!
And then she tried to fix the blame on Gwen."
</p>

<p>
Sybil Ayres listened with eyes starting from her
head.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose Mr. Burmester knows all this?"
she cried.
</p>

<p>
"If he don't, he oughter," said Otis, whose English
was apt to fray, as it were, when he grew familiar or
confidential.  "The person that told him would be doin'
him a kindness.  Look here!  I ought to know something
about that gal, since I was engaged to marry her,
with her mother's consent."
</p>

<p>
"To marry her!  She was only sixteen!" cried Theo.
</p>

<p>
"We were short of gals in Slabbert's Poort," said
Amurrica, with that irresistible dry grin which always
fascinated people.  "But the day her father was buried,
Mestaer, the feller she was carryin' on with, picked a
quarrel with me, fought me, pounded me into a jelly,
and carried off my gal that night."
</p>

<p>
Madeline grew very red.  The seriousness of this
accusation was more than she had contemplated.
After all, Melicent was a Cooper!
</p>

<p>
"You must mean he tried to carry her off," she said
faintly.
</p>

<p>
Major Otis took out the cigar he was smoking&mdash;one
of General Ayres' best&mdash;and touched her sleeve lightly
with one finger.
</p>

<p>
"Cousin of yours?"  He looked round at Sybil with
raised eyebrows.  "Better not.  This pretty young
English lady don't know the sorter thing her cousin
came out of."
</p>

<p>
"Having gone so far, you ought to speak out, I think,"
said Madeline.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, and looked sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
"This young lady is going to be married, I hear&mdash;to
make what's called a good match?"
</p>

<p>
They all assented.
</p>

<p>
"Well then, why spoil her chances?"  He shrugged
his shoulders and replaced his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there are the Burmesters to think of," cried
Sybil Ayres indignantly.  "And the Helstons, whom
she has deceived all these years."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," said Amurrica slowly.  "That's so,
certainly."
</p>

<p>
"You had better tell us what you know; we are her
cousins," said Theo.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what I'm tellin' you now, I'm prepared to swear
to, before any magistrate in this county," he replied, as
if reluctantly.  "It's simply this.  Mestaer carried off
Millie Lutwyche to his house and kept her there.
After some days he deserted her, went off and
enlisted&mdash;and the chaplain chipped in, and sent her home to
her friends.  Arnie Lutwyche will tell you all whether
that's true or not, and you must decide whether
Burmester ought to be told."
</p>

<p>
Madeline and Theo stood looking at one another.
</p>

<p>
"And she pretended to be so honest, and so disgusted
with us for doing things on the quiet!" gasped Madeline
at last.  "Father ought to be told.  Go, Theo, tell him
to come at once and hear what Major Otis has to say."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Lance, in white heat, made his way to
where his party were standing.
</p>

<p>
"Melicent," he said, "do you know there's a brute
of a chap called Otis here to-day&mdash;a fellow that was
notorious in Africa for all kinds of rascality&mdash;telling
everybody that he knows you, and has got a brother of
yours over here with him as his servant.  What does he
mean by such cheek?"
</p>

<p>
Melicent turned quickly to him.  "What does he say?
He has one of the Lutwyche boys here?"
</p>

<p>
"The Lutwyche boys?  Who are they?" cried
Lance, in stupefaction.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Tante Wilma's children," said Millie
disgustedly; "my half-brothers and sisters."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.  Lady Burmester turned a look
of blank astonishment upon Mrs. Helston.
</p>

<p>
"Do I understand that Lance will have a family of
half Boer brothers-in-law?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you knew my father married a Boer
woman after my mother died.  I thought everyone
knew it," said Millie.  "Surely Mr. Mayne told you;
he knows all about it.  It was he who got me away
from Tante Wilma after my father died."
</p>

<p>
Lance cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," he said, "before I again encounter Major
Otis, it will be as well for you to give me further family
information."
</p>

<p>
"It would have been better had it been given before,"
echoed his mother, very stiffly.
</p>

<p>
Melicent dared not look at Bert.  She held up her
little head proudly.
</p>

<p>
"I was under the impression that everyone knew," she
said.  "Pater and Mater certainly do, and I assumed they
had told you long ago.  Please believe that I have never
had the least intention of sailing under false colours."
</p>

<p>
There flashed across Lancelot's mind a memory of a
chance word spoken by Harry Helston the first time he
saw Melicent upon Tod's Trush: "<i>It's not a pretty story,
and I daresay would do the poor child no good in a narrow,
provincial circle?</i>"
</p>

<p>
There were passages in Millie's life of which he knew
nothing, but of which, apparently, the odious Otis knew
much.  It was a rankling thought.
</p>

<p>
Captain Brooke broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"There is one consolation," he observed coolly.
"Otis is such a wholesale liar, he'll soon get found
out.  It might be doing him a kindness if I gave him
a hint to keep himself in the background.  I know
enough about him to make General Ayres regret his
hospitality.  Whatever you do, keep clear of him, Lady
Burmester.  If I may count myself enough your friend
to give you a hint, avoid being introduced to the fellow.
He's not fit to mix with ladies."
</p>

<p>
"Really, Captain Brooke?  I am extremely obliged,"
said Lady Burmester gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"Keep clear of the Ayres party, mother," said Lance.
"Brooke's right, he's a beast.  Come, Melicent, I am
going to start the sports now."
</p>

<p>
He spoke irritably, and Melicent silently walked away
with him, conscious of a burning, fiery resentment
against him, his mother, herself, and Fate generally.
</p>

<p>
Her pride was cruelly wounded, and her conscience
reiterated, "Serve you right!"  She knew that had
she really loved Lancelot she would have known no
peace until she had told him all about Hubert.  She
ought to have done so.  Now some kind of explanation
was unavoidable.  It was impossible but that Lance
should return to the subject.  She now felt certain
that Otis would tell everybody who would listen some
garbled version of her flight from her stepmother's
house.  Vaguely she began to realise how far it was
in his power to injure her; and she knew that, had
Lance been in possession of the actual facts, he would
have had no power to injure her at all.  She had left
her lover in the position of being unable to contradict
effectively anything that might be said.
</p>

<p>
The figure she must cut was not a dignified one.  If
she broke off the engagement, it could but seem that
she did so because she was found out, and dreaded
further revelations.  If she confessed to Lance, he must
feel that she did so only because concealment was no
longer practicable, to say nothing of the suspicions
which she must arouse by the mere fact of not having
spoken before.  She saw that, whatever she did, she
must lower herself, perhaps fatally, in the eyes of her
lover.  She positively shrank from the abyss before her.
She could not see how she could avoid public humiliation,
and what was worse, she must sink in the eyes of
the Helstons too.  They had loved, shielded, trusted
her.  She had wilfully gone her own way, keeping from
them all that most nearly concerned her, locking her
heart, hiding it away from them....
</p>

<p>
It was human nature that, at the moment, Lance's
regard should seem to her more precious than ever
before.  No woman is ready to resign her lover because
she has ceased to be pleasing in his sight.
</p>

<p>
She stood by his side, watching, with eyes that swam
in tears, the great raw-boned Dalesmen slouching round
the sloping, bumpy course with limbs all abroad, yet
keeping up a pace that was undeniable, as they
completed lap after lap of the walking race, which was
the great event of the day, a professional champion from
another county being entered for it.
</p>

<p>
Outwardly she maintained her pride and spirit.  She
smiled and chatted to Lance so naturally that he began
to forget his uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
"Curious," he observed to her presently, "that I never
heard of your father's children."
</p>

<p>
"Vrouw Lutwyche cast me off," said Millie.  "She
repudiated me.  I never expected to hear of her again.
They are well-to-do; there seemed no reason why
they should trouble themselves; they only wanted to
be rid of me."
</p>

<p>
"Still, they are your father's children."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, in her hardest voice, "I suppose so;
but nobody could think it.  They are all Boer, through
and through.  I could not love them.  I am a cold
person, as you know.  I should have told you of them,
if I had not made quite sure you knew."
</p>

<p>
He did not reply for a moment; when he did, what
he said startled her.
</p>

<p>
"It at least shows how far we have been from perfect
confidence."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him astonished, taken aback.  He was
studying the race card.
</p>

<p>
The invitations to the wedding were actually written.
It seemed to Melicent that her marriage was as final a
thing as the fact that autumn follows summer.  She was
frightened, shaken.
</p>

<p>
"Surely," she faltered, "perfect confidence is a thing
that comes by degrees?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it ought to come before marriage, don't
you?" said Lance.
</p>

<p>
She felt as if he had opened an oubliette at her feet.
How could she tell him what ought to be told?  But
evidently she must either do that or lose him.  She
firmly believed that, in his wholesome, out-of-doors life,
were no dark corners concealed from her.
</p>

<p>
However far she was from passion, she liked Lance
dearly.  The idea of his contempt was extremely
painful.
</p>

<p>
All her life she had prided herself upon her honesty!
</p>

<p>
And her attempt to assert her independence of spirit
had led her into this <i>impasse</i>!

MEYNELL.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sybil Ayres, who was animated by a very lively desire
to pay out Lancelot for being about to marry someone
else, manœuvred repeatedly to approach the Burmester
party, and fling her fire-brand into their midst.  But
in some unaccountable way they seemed to elude her.
After a time she appealed to Captain Brooke, who
happened to be passing by.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke, do persuade Miss Lutwyche to come
this way!  Her brother is here, and wants to see her."
</p>

<p>
"What, one of the Boer boys?  He had better go
and call upon her to-morrow at Glen Royd, I should
think.  This is a public sort of meeting-place; and
as you see, she is leaving the ground now with Lady
Burmester's party."
</p>

<p>
"It looks just as if Miss Lutwyche was avoiding
him," tittered Miss Ayres.
</p>

<p>
"It is Major Otis whom they are all avoiding, by
my advice," said the Captain gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Because he knows all about Miss Lutwyche's
African life?  That looks as if there were something
to be ashamed of, doesn't it?" said the girl
impertinently.
</p>

<p>
"Not on that account, but because&mdash;you will pardon
my speaking so of the General's guest&mdash;with my
consent, no woman of my acquaintance should speak
to such a man."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke!"
</p>

<p>
"I will say the same to Otis himself, if you wish.
He has no business in any gentleman's house, and he
knows it.  Whatever he told me, I should be sure was
a lie, merely because Otis said it."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;" stammered Sybil, crimson, "the vicar
says that all Major Otis tells him is borne out by his
own knowledge, only the real facts were kept from him
by Mr. Mayne.  The Major says he is prepared to
swear before any magistrate that all he says is
true."
</p>

<p>
"Then he has actually presumed to make charges
against Miss Lutwyche?" asked the Captain, his eyes
like blue fire.  "You can tell him from me that wilful
perjury's a serious matter in England."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Captain Brooke, do you really think that what
he says about Miss Lutwyche is untrue?  Because the
vicar is gone to lay the matter before Sir Joseph.  He
felt it his duty.  Major Otis says Miss Lutwyche, if
asked, can't, and won't deny it."
</p>

<p>
"Deny what?" asked Brooke, in a tone that, as
Sybil afterwards declared, sent cold shivers down her
back.
</p>

<p>
"If&mdash;if it's true, Miss Lutwyche ought not&mdash;  But I
couldn't possibly tell you!"
</p>

<p>
"Yet you could listen," he broke in.  "You could
stand by while that coward dared to mishandle the
name of a girl you have known for years!  You could
believe his vile accusations!  Well, now, he has chosen
to do this thing in public, and I'll make him regret it to
the last day he lives.  I'll just trouble Major Otis to
repeat his lies to me!  Excuse plain speaking.  But I
know this man, and you don't."
</p>

<p>
The Burmester party, including the vicar and the
Helstons, were just driving away as he strode with his
long, firm stride, across the field to where the Major
stood, a cluster of eager listeners around him.  His hand
rested on the shoulder of a big, slouching boy, swarthy,
with high cheek-bones and little black eyes, who seemed
about as unlike what one would imagine Melicent's
brother as anything could be.
</p>

<p>
"This boy can tell you it's all true," he was saying,
"and so could Mestaer, if he hadn't got shot as a spy
later on, in the campaign."
</p>

<p>
"I knew Mestaer," said the Captain, in a carrying
voice.  "Perhaps the fact may serve as an introduction
between us, Major.  Now you tell me, straight out, the
truth about him and Miss Lutwyche, just as you have
been telling these friends of ours, will you?"
</p>

<p>
Eager faces, wearing expressions of various kinds,
pressed nearer as Otis, wholly unsuspicious, repeated
his version of Millie's flight from her father's house.
</p>

<p>
Alfred Dow was close to Bert; Mrs. Cooper and her
daughters not far off.
</p>

<p>
The Captain listened with perfect calmness.  When
it was done, he said quietly: "That all?"
</p>

<p>
"That's all; and if I were Burmester, I'd think it
enough," he said, laughing brutally.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Bert, "then my turn comes.  You have
had no scruple in saying this abominable thing out before
ladies, which alone might have opened their eyes as to
the kind of refuse you are; so I have no scruple in telling
you, before ladies, that you lie.  You lie, sir, as a Boer
traitor might be expected to do.  Yes, grin!  Show
them all the false teeth you wear in place of those
Mestaer knocked down your throat on the day you laid
your plans against Miss Lutwyche!  Hold your tongue!
You've had your innings this afternoon; now I'm going
to have mine!  You lied again when you said Mestaer
was shot.  He is alive, as you probably know.  What
you don't know is that he is in England.  The Bishop
of Pretoria is in England too.  Both these witnesses
can prove the untruth of your story, as you know; and
I both can and will produce them&mdash;not here, but in
open court, unless you confess yourself a malicious liar,
and offer a public apology.  If you don't withdraw every
word you have said against Miss Lutwyche this
afternoon, you shall pay such swingeing damages as shall
exhaust the last of the loot you stole when you were in
the Boer Irish Brigade, before the taking of Kroonstadt.
Ha, you see, I know!"
</p>

<p>
He had spoken without a pause.  The white intensity
of his rage had carried him along, and the silent
sympathy of the excited audience seemed to make itself
felt.  Amurrica had several times tried to break in, but
in vain.  But now he uttered a howl of rage, and
fuming, turned to those about him.
</p>

<p>
"He thinks to frighten me!  He thinks he can&mdash;  By
the&mdash;&mdash;  Who are you, sir?  Who are you to take up
the cudgels for this young lady?"
</p>

<p>
"I have the privilege to be a friend of Miss
Lutwyche," said Hubert, raising his hat as he spoke
with a quiet grace which gave the effect of saluting her
name.  "I also know the Orange Colony like the palm
of my hand.  There's not a man in that colony that
would believe you on your oath.  If I allowed this
gathering to disperse without knowing you for the
scoundrel you are, I should be failing in my duty to this
country.  Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the
slander uttered by this renegade.  I shall now tell you
the truth, in as few words as possible.  Miss Lutwyche
was left an orphan at the age of sixteen, in a Boer
village which a year or two before had got filled with
sweepings from other parts of Africa, come there in
search of diamonds.  This man, who had long cast eyes
on her, paid her stepmother a sum of money to hand
her over to him on her father's death.  But Mr. Mayne,
the chaplain, had been left her guardian, which
interfered with their design.  Mayne had to go away on
urgent business connected with the will.  In his absence
it was plotted that Otis should go through a form of
marriage with the girl at the hands of the Boer
Predikant.  But, as they knew the indomitable spirit of
Miss Lutwyche, the Boer woman thrashed her within an
inch of her life to reduce her to a proper state of
submission.  In escaping from her torturers, she fell down
a ladder, and dislocated her arm.  That seems to have
frightened them somewhat, for they let her creep away
to her garret to die.  Mestaer, who had been asked by
Mayne to keep watch, went to the house, found her
lying in a pool of blood, and carried her to his
home.  Where else could he have taken her?  He put
her in charge of his housekeeper, fetched a doctor at
once, and mounted guard until Mayne's return, when he
went off to the war.  Now, you ask that boy there,
whether this is true or no.  Here, boy! did your mother
sjambok your sister?"
</p>

<p>
All eyes were turned upon the uncouth lad.  He
lifted his eyes to his questioner with a very curious
look; he did not seem to notice Otis, who still kept a
heavy hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she did," he replied sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"Was it done at Otis's suggestion?"
</p>

<p>
Here the boy shook off the Major's touch, and
stood up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; to make her go quiet; only mother was drunk,
and she done too much."
</p>

<p>
There was a kind of growl all round among the
listening Dalesmen.  Otis grew green, and clenched
his fist.
</p>

<p>
"You shall pay for this!" he muttered to the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Had Otis paid your mother to arrange the matter?"
went on Bert relentlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And this is the cur," said Hubert, between his
teeth, "who has dared to slander a young innocent girl
before you all this day."
</p>

<p>
Otis was literally foaming at the mouth.  His
mortification was choking him.
</p>

<p>
"I said what was true!" he screamed.  "Mestaer
did carry her off!  I said no more!  She was in his
house!  That's all I said."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and that's what you'll go to hell for saying!"
shouted Dow, cracking a formidable whip he held, and
stamping with excitement.  "It isn't a sjambok,
Captain, but let me lay it round him once or twice!
Let me just give him the feel of it!  Do now!"
</p>

<p>
Bert waved him back.
</p>

<p>
"If it wasn't for his health," he said, "I would be
inclined to let you do as you liked with him.  But he's
ill, Dow, and he mustn't be touched.  But if there's a
soul present will let him inside his doors after this, I
shall be surprised.  You're a discredited traitor," he
said fiercely to the livid Otis.  "How you got your
commission is one of the many mysteries of the late
campaign.  Having come through so far, you might
have had the common decency to lie low and keep your
poisonous tongue quiet!"
</p>

<p>
Otis appealed, gasping in his rage, to General Ayres;
but the General turned his back upon him.
</p>

<p>
"We took our convalescents on trust," he said coldly.
"That trust the War Office has betrayed.  I will send
your luggage to any address you like to give me."
</p>

<p>
"But look here&mdash;is this justice, bare justice?  His
word against mine, that's all you've got, except for this
lying little Boer&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We all know and respect Captain Brooke," said the
General, bowing to Hubert.  "I may add, we all know
and admire Miss Lutwyche."  He raised his hat, as
Hubert had done.  "Gentlemen, may I venture to
suggest&mdash;three cheers for Miss Lutwyche?"
</p>

<p>
The field rang again.  The hurrahs rolled away
across the Dale, and Brenda remarked, as they drove
silently."
</p>

<p>
"That must have been a close race!  Hark, how they
are cheering the winner!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"You rat&mdash;you little viper!" hissed Amurrica, as he
hastened, with Arnie at his side, to get the dog-cart
from the farm where it was put up, and drive away from
the scene of his disgrace, "why in thunder did you give
me away like that?"
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before the sullen answer came:
</p>

<p>
"Always was afraid of him."
</p>

<p>
"Afraid of me?"
</p>

<p>
"No fear," said Arnie, with a laugh.  "Not much.
But I always have been feared of Bert Mestaer."
</p>

<p>
"What?"  Otis gave a kind of jump into the air.
"Mestaer?  That?  Mestaer coming the county
gentleman?  And I never knew it!  You little devil, why
didn't you tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"Thought you'd know him."
</p>

<p>
Otis stood still in the dusty lane.  He went from red
to pale, and almost to purple again.
</p>

<p>
"If he thinks he's done with me, he makes a mistake,
that's all," he growled; and he snarled like a wild beast.

CHAPTER XXXV
<br><br>
CONFESSION
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Well, I have played and lost.  But that is best.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was my right to win and keep such glory?<br>
  Now I will let the book of living rest.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed is my story."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;ALICE HERBERT.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Hubert's motor traversed the distance from the sports
to Ilbersdale at a rate so far beyond the police limit as
to make limits seem ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
On his way he encountered Mr. Cooper, pushing his
bicycle up hill.  The seething excitement which had
gripped him that afternoon had not yet expended itself;
and he pulled up.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Vicar.  Just a word!  I hope you
have not been to the Burmesters with any of those awful
lies about your niece that Otis was getting off his chest
in that field?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar assumed his most stony aspect.  His cold
eye said eloquently, "Beware!"  Aloud his reply was:
"I fear I do not understand you, Captain Brooke."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry; it's my slang makes me difficult to follow.
I drop into it when I'm excited.  You see, I happen to
know all about Otis, and I've just been enlightening
the bystanders a bit.  There isn't enough of him left to
make a War Office clerk!  They've hissed him off the
ground, General Ayres has washed his hands of him,
and I've given him twelve hours to choose between a
libel action and a written apology."
</p>

<p>
"It is a&mdash;surely&mdash;a somewhat extraordinary
proceeding on your part to talk of libel actions on
behalf of a young lady who has her own relatives
to protect her," said the vicar, fastening, in the whirl
of his mind, upon a breach of conventionalities which
he might legitimately resent.
</p>

<p>
"Her own relatives didn't seem to me to be doing
much protecting this afternoon," observed Bert drily.
"However, Mrs. Cooper and your daughters will be able
to tell you all about it.  They saw the brute knocked
out of time."
</p>

<p>
The vicar began to be anxious to get home.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy you are under a misapprehension," he said.
"I have just been to Ilbersdale to correct a misunderstanding.
I own I was disturbed this afternoon to find
that Mr. and Mrs. Helston had allowed the engagement
between Mr. Burmester and my niece to take place,
without informing the bridegroom's relatives of the
serious family disabilities of the bride.  I was anxious
to assure Lady Burmester that, had the affair rested
with me, I should have been quite frank; but that I
naturally imagined that Miss Lutwyche's adopted
parents had supplied all the facts."
</p>

<p>
"That was very thoughtful of you.  But if you were,
as you say, in possession of the facts, how is it that you
did not contradict the horrible misstatements made by
Otis up at the field?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar grew still more stony.
</p>

<p>
"I have never been made acquainted with the exact
truth concerning my niece's injuries at the time of her
father's death."
</p>

<p>
"Injuries?" echoed Bert.  "Injuries, indeed!  But
I've seen her righted.  She was the darling of the
Dale before; she'll be its idol now!  Did you hear
them cheering her?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar stood amazed.  "Cheering my niece?"
</p>

<p>
Hubert laughed mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"And who may you be, to have the intimate
knowledge which I lack concerning this young lady?"
inquired the vicar.
</p>

<p>
"Hubert Brooke, late Captain in Lacy's Brigade,"
laughed Bert, as he drove away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cooper pursued his road, in much wrath and
discomfiture.  His reception at Ilbersdale had affronted
him, his encounter with Bert bewildered him.  He
remounted the bicycle which he was pushing at the
time of his meeting, and rode home with what speed
he might.
</p>

<p>
By the Vicarage gate two men were awaiting him&mdash;Otis
and the unattractive Boer boy.  Evidently they
meant to speak with him.
</p>

<p>
Otis approached with the easy confidence and winning
smile that he could assume at will.  He begged pardon
for troubling, but he had unthinkingly mixed himself
up in what looked to him like a local scandal of
formidable dimensions, and he had come to the vicar for
advice.  Mr. Cooper's anger was not altogether proof
against the insidious appeal.  He was used to being
ignored and left out of things, and, to one whose own
idea of his own importance, both socially and
parochially, was enormous, the way this man approached
him was a salve to a wound always more or less
smarting.
</p>

<p>
After a short parley, understanding that Otis had
material facts to communicate, he invited him in.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper and her daughters were at tea; and
there was a flutter of consternation among them
for they had seen the exit of Otis from the Fransdale
sports.  Mrs. Cooper became unspeakably coy, blushing
like a girl, and dismissing her brood, with their tea half
done, on the flimsiest of pretexts.
</p>

<p>
"This is not surprisin', Mrs. Cooper," said Otis sadly.
"I was a stranger up there, and nobody knew me.  It
was my word against that of a bad and dangerous man,
who is sailin' among you all under false colours.
These young ladies heard him givin' me the lie up
there.  In justice, I should like to have them hear
what I want to tell you now.  You may have heard
Mr. Mayne or Miss Lutwyche talk of the man
Mestaer?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," gasped Madeline, at the door.  "She had
one letter from him after she got here&mdash;you remember,
mother, the letter she would not show you.  She said
he wanted to marry her!"
</p>

<p>
"She wouldn't show you his letter?" slowly said
Otis, standing by the table, and turning his hat round
in his hand as if on the point of taking leave.  "Has
she ever told you that he goes now under the name
of Brooke?"
</p>

<p>
"What's that you say?" sharply asked the vicar.
</p>

<p>
"He's well disguised," replied Otis.  "He bluffed me,
I own it.  But Arnie here, he knew him from the first;
didn't you, boy?"
</p>

<p>
Arnold looked at the three tall, full-blown girls,
blushed admiringly and assented.
</p>

<p>
Surprise deprived them all of speech.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I'm told," said Otis, "that this fine Captain
Brooke is buildin' himself a house, and that Miss
Lutwyche is his&mdash;architect."  He gave a little chuckle,
"Excuse me: I really got to laff," he drawled
humorously.  "The idea of him an' his architect is
a bit too thick&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lutwyche is duly qualified," began the vicar,
in his stateliest manner.
</p>

<p>
"Do I doubt it?  No, sir!  But I hear she has been
stayin' down in the shires with him pretty near all
summer, gettin' this house ready while her lover's in
Russia.  Now, I couldn't help just wonderin'&mdash;we
really couldn't help it, Arnie and me&mdash;whether young
Burmester knows that Brooke's her old lover."
</p>

<p>
"Why, do you think <i>she</i> knows?" cried Theo
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Otis bent on her the sliest, most waggish look, and
slowly closed one eye.
</p>

<p>
"Dear young ladies, you live in Arcadia," he said.
"You remind me of three hedge-roses; an' you're
doubtless as simple as you're sweet.  But your cousin,
Miss Lutwyche, she wasn't born yesterday, you know.
She knows a thing or two, you may take my word for
that."
</p>

<p>
The vicar was silent, struggling with mortification.
That day he had broken through his lifelong rule to do
nothing hurriedly.  He had gone straight from hearing
Otis's revelations to be first with Lady Burmester.
He felt sure that what was said must ultimately come
to her ears.  He thought his duty was plain.
</p>

<p>
But if he had only waited!  If he had only gone to
Millie, armed with this fact!  If he could have charged
her with knowing who Bert was, and concealing her
knowledge, how differently things might have gone!
</p>

<p>
He looked at his wife, who seemed to be still blushing.
She rose from table.
</p>

<p>
"As you say, Mr. Otis," said she, with archness
which was unutterably comic upon her middle-aged,
substantial personality, "my dear girls are very
unsophisticated.  They have been carefully brought up,
as English girls usually are.  I will leave you to discuss
this serious matter with Mr. Cooper, and take them
away.  Come, my darlings."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Bert drove straight to the Grange, inquired
for Lance, and found him alone in the smoking-room,
sunk in profound gloom and a large arm-chair.
</p>

<p>
"Burmester," he said abruptly, "I've come to talk
to you&mdash;to tell you something that will perhaps sever
our friendship for ever.  Confession is good, they say;
but I funk mine."  He sank down in the opposite chair,
drawing out his cigar-case.  "I funk it; make it as
easy as you can, old man."
</p>

<p>
Lance was not smoking.  He lifted a haggard young
face from the depths of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry," he said nervously, "but fact is, I'm feeling
a bit off&mdash;preoccupied.  I must own I'm not in a
sympathetic mood."
</p>

<p>
"It's about that&mdash;same thing.  My confession touches
the spot," said Hubert.
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"You are upset because you find scandal busy with
the name of ... your ... the girl you love.  And
because you feel she hasn't been open with you.  You
don't doubt her, but you feel there are things you should
have known, which she has kept back.  Is that so?"
</p>

<p>
"That's precisely it," said Lance hurriedly.  "I
oughtn't to talk to you about it&mdash;about her.  But there
must be some kind of understanding between me and
her if&mdash;if things are to go on.  I feel a brute, to talk
like this, but I am all abroad, so to speak.  We have
had a very unpleasant scene here.  Old Cooper turned
up, and said there were wild rumours flying about, on
the authority of those who claimed to have known her
in Africa, to the effect that she, Melicent, had got out
of her bedroom window and gone with a man called
Mestaer, and that she had been in his house three or
four weeks.  He said he came to Melicent for an
authoritative contradiction.  He wished to be able to
refute the story; thought he had a right to ask for the
exact facts."
</p>

<p>
He leaned forward, running his hands up through his
hair.
</p>

<p>
Hubert sat very still.  "And what did she say?"
</p>

<p>
"... Said it was true."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.  "Not as if she meant it?" asked
Hubert tentatively.
</p>

<p>
"She was very angry.  She looked splendid.  She
said that it was at her uncle's own request that she had
kept silence&mdash;that when she first came to England she
was anxious to tell him everything, but was forbidden
to mention the subject.  If we wanted to know the
truth we could write to the Bishop: he knew.  Then
she got up and took her leave, and went off with the
Helstons.  Of course I know this is a cock-and-bull
story; but I feel ... I ought to have been told."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed his friend, "you ought to have been
told."
</p>

<p>
"One thing I do wish," said Lance, clenching his
fists, "that I had that man Mestaer here to strangle."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if all our wishes could be as easily granted,"
said Hubert.  "I'm Mestaer."
</p>

<p>
Lance bounded from his seat, then sank back, as
red as fire.
</p>

<p>
"Is this a time for your rotting?"
</p>

<p>
"No rotting here.  I told you it would mean the
breaking of our friendship very likely.  I am Hubert
Mestaer.  I took the name of Brooke because it was
English, and my mother's, and I wished to live in
England and be English.  May I go on, or are you
too angry to hear me?"
</p>

<p>
Lance rose to his feet again.  He stared blankly for
a minute or two, then his eyes suddenly blazed.
</p>

<p>
"You're Mestaer!  Good God!  <i>Then you're the man
that knows!</i>  You can tell me ... what happened that
night!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I can tell you: and I will.  Mayne knows, she
knows, I know.  Nobody else."
</p>

<p>
A shiver ran through Lancelot; he seemed on the
brink of a hundred questions; he choked them back.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, can't you?" he said.
</p>

<p>
Hubert spoke.  He told his story from the beginning,
making Melicent's attitude towards himself throughout
quite clear.  He did not dwell on his own feelings, but
made it no secret that he had come to England solely
in the hope of being able to obtain her regard.
</p>

<p>
Lancelot listened to it all, as to information respecting
some girl whom he had never known.
</p>

<p>
"That she should have undergone all this, and never
told me a word!"
</p>

<p>
"I can see where her difficulty came in," said Bert
"Before she engaged herself to you, she had guessed
who I am.  That altered everything.  If you can see
what I mean, it turned the past into the present.  She
could not speak to you of Mestaer without adding that
he was here, in England, under another name.  That
would have been giving me away&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why couldn't she warn you that she should speak?"
</p>

<p>
"She never confessed to me that she knew.  She
tried to avoid intimacy."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have told me yourself!" cried Lance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, until she engaged herself to you, it was
certainly no concern of yours," said Hubert bluntly.
"Do you suppose that what you are feeling now is
anything like as bad as what I felt about you, when
I heard you had carried off the only thing that made
life worth living to me?"
</p>

<p>
Lance paced the room restlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Is that still the same?" he cried.  "Do you still
care about her?"
</p>

<p>
"It's chronic," said Bert calmly.  "There's only one
woman in my world.  She might have Boer relations
on every bush for aught I should care.  Nothing she
could do, nothing anybody could say of her, would
make any difference to me."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;then&mdash;when she's my wife?" stammered Lance.
</p>

<p>
"When she's&mdash;your wife I shall never see her any
more," said Bert quietly.  "It wouldn't be safe."
</p>

<p>
"Safe?  No!  But am I safe now?" cried the
young man bitterly.  "I don't understand.  What is
the situation at this moment between you and her?"
</p>

<p>
Bert folded his arms tight, hunching himself together
as if to keep control over his temper.
</p>

<p>
"That's a question, surely, that you must ask her to
answer," he said, in a colourless voice.
</p>

<p>
Lance uttered an exclamation of rage.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know without asking," went on
Hubert presently.  "Does she love you?  Surely you
must know that,  If she does ... I'm out of it, you see."
</p>

<p>
Lancelot paused in his pacing.  He leaned against
the window-frame staring out Hubert had touched
the weak spot.  He knew that he had persuaded Millie
into the engagement, had ever since continued to assure
her that she was happy, or that, if not, she certainly
would be.  He knew that, were he sure of her love,
distrust would be impossible to him.  He was not sure.
He did distrust her.  He was madly, wildly jealous of
Hubert.  Crossing to where he sat, he seized his
shoulder, shaking him violently.
</p>

<p>
"When she promised to marry me, did she know who
you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's all right!  It must be!  She said she
liked me better than anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"If she said so, it was true."
</p>

<p>
"She's&mdash;she's not like most girls, you see.  She's a
cold nature&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is she?"
</p>

<p>
Hubert closed his eyes, thinking of the lips that had
clung to his, the eyes that had looked into his, the
hands that had trembled beneath his, as they stood
together in the chalky pit He got up suddenly: he
had had about as much as he could stand.
</p>

<p>
At the moment a footman entered, with a note on a
salver.
</p>

<p>
"From her," said Lance, very white, as the man left
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Breaking it off," said Hubert, relighting his cold
cigar with a shaking hand.
</p>

<p>
Lance read it
</p>

<p>
"Just so.  She declines to give any kind of
explanation of the statements made by Mr. Cooper.
She prefers to consider the engagement at an end."  He
stood silent a moment, the note crumpled in his
hand.  "I'll go to her," he said unsteadily.  "I've
simply got to have it out with her!  When she hears
that I know&mdash;that you have told me"&mdash;he was half-way
to the door.  Then he stopped, as if choked.  "When
I think that I have never known all this!  When I
think that I have been shut out from her confidence,
and that you&mdash;you&mdash;have known all the time!  When
I think that I've been away in Russia and you two,
with this common memory between you, have been
together!  Day after day!  Over that confounded
house-building!  I feel that I have good ground to
consider myself hardly used."
</p>

<p>
Hubert turned slowly round.  He was so white that
Lance considered him attentively.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you told me now?" he cried.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Only because it couldn't be helped," returned
Hubert, in a hard voice.
</p>

<p>
"And, but for this scoundrel turning up, she would
have married me without a word!  Brooke, I can't
stand it!  No man could!  She's right, it had better
be broken off."
</p>

<p>
"Steady on!" said Bert, getting out his words with
difficulty.  "Listen a moment!  She may be offering
you your freedom because she believes you desire it.
She is&mdash;very proud.  She may think this miserable
tittle-tattle has shaken your faith in her, and she offers
you your way out.  What you have to discover, or so
it seems to me, is <i>the cost to herself</i>.  Does she want to
be free?"  He took out his handkerchief and wiped
his forehead.  "Everyone round here will say you have
treated her badly if it's broken off now.  That doesn't
matter if it isn't true.  But make sure&mdash;make sure, for
God's sake!"
</p>

<p>
Lance stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"You're a queer chap.  You must want the engagement
to be off&mdash;that would give you your chance.  Yet
you send me to her!"
</p>

<p>
Bert shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, with a half laugh, "I've discovered
to-day that I've been mistaken all these years.  Ever
since I was four-and-twenty I have believed that most
of everything on this earth I desired&mdash;her.  Now I find
there is something that I desire more&mdash;her happiness.
If you're the man to make her happy, in God's name
go and do it."

CHAPTER XXXVI
<br><br>
WHAT CHANCED UPON THE MOORS
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "What can I give thee back, O liberal<br>
  And princely giver, who hast brought the gold<br>
  And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,<br>
  And laid them on the outside of the wall<br>
  For such as I to take or leave withal?"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Lancelot had gone to Glen Royd.
</p>

<p>
Bert found that he could not stay indoors.  He
wandered out, through the gardens, into the long
carriage drive which ran upon the side of the ravine,
among the pines, with a sheer ascent on one hand, and
a sheer dip on the other, down to where the trout
stream rushed over its noisy bed.
</p>

<p>
He paced along the road, dark beneath the over-arching
trees, till he came to the lodge and gate at the
end of the wood.  There was no sign of Lance returning,
so he walked on, and bending to the left, came, after a
climb, out upon the highroad to Fransdale.  Nobody
was about.  He sat down upon a grassy hummock,
watching the pretty horned sheep cropping the short
grass about him in the fragrant evening.  He was so
still that the sheep grazed nearer and nearer.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking that man is strangely in the grip of
circumstance.
</p>

<p>
Since that night of parting at Clunbury, he had been
through deep waters.  Carol, who had been so long
excluded, was summoned at last.  The final knock-out
had been too serious for the champion to bear alone.
</p>

<p>
He had laid all the circumstances before the Bishop,
and told him that he would follow his advice as to the
course now to be pursued&mdash;whether he should let things
go on, or make one more effort to show Melicent what
he believed to be the truth, to induce her to break her
engagement.
</p>

<p>
In the light of what he now heard&mdash;namely, that
Melicent had almost at once recognised Bert&mdash;Mayne
had little difficulty in falling in with Bert's opinion as to
her reason for engaging herself to Lance.  His disapproval
of the said proceeding was so grave that he
felt, and said, that he really thought it would be better
for Bert to have nothing more to do with her.
</p>

<p>
"Incredible selfishness and duplicity," he mercilessly
called it at first, till warned by Bert's rising anger that
strictures upon Melicent would merely have the effect of
drying up the flow of confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I began the duplicity," said Bert doggedly.  "I
don't see what she could do but follow suit."
</p>

<p>
"Does that excuse your further duplicity," came the
answering thrust, "in proceeding to make love to her
while Lance was in Russia?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm hanged if I see what the d&mdash;"  A sudden
pause.  "I quite fail to see what other course I could
have taken.  They were to be married when he came
back.  I had got to show her before then that the
thing couldn't be done.  And I succeeded, within a
hair's-breadth.  If it hadn't been for my d&mdash;!  Beg
pardon! if it hadn't been for my&mdash;unfortunate temper,
I should have succeeded."
</p>

<p>
"From what you tell me," the Bishop opined, "it
really seems as if she does like you best, but as if her
pride would not allow her to give way.  The question
is&mdash;Has your violence destroyed your chance finally?
I think you ought to find out."
</p>

<p>
"You do?&mdash;you do?  You think I might have
another try?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, are you to be trusted to keep yourself in
check?  You know of old that when you lose your
temper you have no chance at all with Millie, because
she never loses hers."
</p>

<p>
Hubert grinned.  "She did the other night, though."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think she said things that she will be
ashamed of when she thinks them over?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do."
</p>

<p>
"Then I think that should give you a hold of a new
kind over her.  If you can only manage to put her in
the wrong, old man, and be magnanimous and forgive
her&mdash;see?"
</p>

<p>
Bert's admiration was open and glowing.
</p>

<p>
"You have a genius!  You ought to marry,
Bishop&mdash;you ought really."
</p>

<p>
"My advice is," finally said the mentor, "that you go
at once to Fransdale, and see how the land lies.  See
what frame of mind Millie is in.  If she is scornful and
gay, and wrapped up in Lance and her marriage, your
course will be more difficult.  If she shows you, by
word or look, that she thinks she behaved ill, or wounded
you, or desires your good opinion, then to my thinking
you have a chance that you ought to take.  You have
now been disciplined by failure; you should have learnt
something; and Melicent also must be wiser.  For if
she has any feeling at all&mdash;which, as you know, I always
took leave to doubt&mdash;she must have suffered keenly
during these last few months."
</p>

<p>
It was with the ring of this advice in his ears that
Bert had hurled himself and his motor through England,
and arrived at Fransdale, where in his rage he had
vowed never to set foot more.
</p>

<p>
At the first sight of Melicent he believed that he had
done right to come.
</p>

<p>
And behold, an hour later, all things were changed;
the chance appearance of Otis had, as it were, altered
the entire situation.  Bert was no longer suppliant, but
defender of Melicent's name against all comers&mdash;even
against the man she was to marry.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that, whether she ever came to care
for himself or no, she must break with Lance; for,
knowing her as he did, he was sure that now she must
feel that, if the engagement went on, full confession of
all that had passed was imperative; and that seemed
impossible.
</p>

<p>
Suspense grew and mounted in him till he felt
desperate; yet still he sat there, with a kind of
charmed stillness, while the quiet-coloured end of
evening slowly merged in twilight.
</p>

<p>
It was growing dark when at last he saw figures
moving along the path that led up on the other side
of the ridge from Glen Royd&mdash;two figures, indistinct at
first in the dusk, then clearer.  It was Lancelot and
Melicent walking together.  Bert felt dizzy.
</p>

<p>
Then he had lost!  They were reconciled!  They
moved slowly along, and he saw that Lance was
pushing her bicycle.
</p>

<p>
He rose and obliterated himself hastily behind a
craggy boulder.
</p>

<p>
They both turned into the road leading to the carriage
drive of the Grange, which was also a short cut to the
lower parts of Fransdale.  They passed in complete
silence, and he watched them along the white track
of road until they were lost in the shadows of the wood.
</p>

<p>
A light glimmered out in the lodge window.  It was
the only sign of human life within his ken.
</p>

<p>
Lance must be bringing her back to dine, and
intending to cycle home with her afterwards.  He lit a
match and looked at his watch.  A quarter to eight.
He could not meet them.  He realised that he must
have time.
</p>

<p>
He had done what he believed to be right&mdash;told the
truth, as far as he thought it permissible, to wipe away
from his conscience the stain of his treachery to Lance.
And the result was that they were reconciled, and he
was left in outer darkness.  He knew that he had not
expected it.
</p>

<p>
His misery was too great for him to reflect at present.
He could not tell what he should do.  He plunged
down the hill-side with no thought at first but to
walk, to get away, to move fast, to fight down some
overwhelming bitterness of darkness which was clutching
him.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the valley by the mill he turned and
hastened up stream by the fishing-path among the thick
trees.  Careless of his direction, he walked on until he
was at the head of Ilbersdale, and had emerged from
the woods upon the open, broken moor that lay at the
feet of Fransdale.  There he lifted up his eyes, and saw
far above him, perched upon the very verge of the
precipice, the lights of Ilberston Church and Vicarage.
</p>

<p>
He thought of Mr. Hall.  It occurred to him to
wonder whether this man, whose personality had
impressed him, as it impressed most people, would have
help or counsel for him.  Anyhow, to breast that hill
was something to attempt&mdash;something that chimed in
with his mood just then.
</p>

<p>
It was choir practice night, and the church door
being open, the sound of the sweet Cleveshire voices
floated out over the uplands, and made articulate the
beauty of the night.
</p>

<p>
Hubert pushed his way hurriedly, yet not fast, because
heedlessly, over the broken ground, with which he was
not familiar.  There were short cuts, but in the dusk he
did not find them.  Several times he was brought up
short by hollow ravines or boggy ground, and it was
long before he struck the road that leads up to the steep
verge.
</p>

<p>
He had been walking for nearly two hours when at
last he found himself at the top.  The full moon was up,
and was flooding the moors with silver.  The prospect
was grand.  On the horizon line the Three Howes
stood up black against the radiance&mdash;the prehistoric
burial-place of forgotten chiefs.  At his back the white
crosses that mark the resting-places of the Dalesmen
glimmered among the neatly shorn grass of the
churchyard.
</p>

<p>
He sat upon the low wall, gazing out over the silent
waste.  The church was in darkness now, and closed; the
village beyond showed but few lights.  The lamp
over the Vicarage door beamed steadily upon the
night, and showed a lady's bicycle leaning against
the Vicarage garden wall.  Surely the little brown
basket on the handle-bars was familiar to him?
Surely he had seen that same machine leaning
against the trees of the plantation at Lone Ash?
</p>

<p>
He sprang from his seat and went up close.  It was
Melicent's bicycle.  Then she herself was within!  She
had not gone to dine with the Burmesters; she had
come straight up here to Mr. Hall.  A wave of
excitement passed over Hubert.  Should he go in, and
let the priest hear both sides of the question?  What
had happened&mdash;what had passed between her and
Lance?  If he had not played the coward, and run
away, he would have known by now.  As he hesitated,
the Vicarage door opened.  He saw Mr. Hall stand in
the light, with the girl beside him.  For the second
time that night he drew back and hid himself.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ride the steep bit to-night," he heard Mr. Hall
say, as he lit her lamp.
</p>

<p>
"I know every inch of the way; it's really quite safe,"
was the characteristic response.
</p>

<p>
"I shall feel more comfortable if you promise me.  It
is late for you to be returning alone, but I cannot come
with you; I must go on to poor old Martha Hirst."
</p>

<p>
Millie's little laugh sounded sad.  "You needn't be
nervous about me on these moors at night."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I need, or I would not let you go; but
the moon is glorious.  Good-night, and God bless you!"
</p>

<p>
She mounted, and rode swiftly away, past the church,
along the little level bit of road that came before the
steep dip over the mountain-side.  The brief dialogue
had decided Bert.  Mr. Hall was not at leisure, and
Millie was riding home late, alone.  His place was to
follow her.  He had ascertained that there was a
footpath which was far shorter than the windings she must
go down with her cycle.  If she were going to walk the
steep bit, he thought he could overtake her when she
dismounted to walk up the next ascent.
</p>

<p>
At the lower end of the steep hill, if you followed the
road, you came to a stone bridge; and here the Ilba
flowed more silently, and deep pools harboured many
a fat trout.  Trees arched over the road, growing by
the water-side; and under them were inky shadows.
</p>

<p>
Melicent's lamp gleamed brightly, but not bright
enough to show the wire fastened across the road.
She was riding fast, with the impetus of the long hill
just negotiated, and she checked herself with difficulty
as the figure of a man detached itself from the shadow,
waving his arms and crying, "Stop!  Danger!  You'll
fall!"
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" she cried, putting on her
brakes and just managing to alight "You!"&mdash;she
stopped short, recognising Amurrica.
</p>

<p>
"We were gettin' ready for someone else," said
Amurrica drily.  "This is an unexpected pleasure.
Are you ridin' alone?"
</p>

<p>
"You see that I am."
</p>

<p>
"Our friend's gone home another way then, seemin'ly.
But as you're here, let's make the most of it.  Give us
a kiss, little Millie."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a cad, Amurrica!" said Millie, with a most
unlooked-for gentleness.  "I don't know why you
stopped me, but I am glad you did, for there are things
I want to say to you.  Is my brother here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Arnie, slouching out from the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"Amurrica," said Millie earnestly, "first of everything,
I want to beg your pardon.  You were very cruel to me
in the old days, but I have been shown to-day that it
was my fault.  I was hard and insolent.  If I had been
a different kind of girl, perhaps you'd not have wanted
to injure me?"
</p>

<p>
Amurrica stood staring.  Was this Millie?  "What
yer givin' us?" he growled.
</p>

<p>
"I want to say I am sorry," said the girl steadily.
"I was hard and insolent to you again to-day.  I
provoked you to try and do me harm.  But I&mdash;didn't
know you had Arnie with you.  I&mdash;I remember Arnie
when he was a dear little curly-headed baby.  I
never was good to him.  I was always&mdash;disagreeable.
Arnie, I&mdash;am&mdash;so&mdash;sorry!  I want to say&mdash;forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice broke.  She turned her head away and
drew out a handkerchief.  Amurrica was stricken dumb.
That Millie could humble herself&mdash;that Millie could
cry&mdash;these incidents had seemed to him utterly out of the
range of the things that happen.  He had nothing to
say.  Arnie giggled awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
"Amurrica," said Millie earnestly, laying a hand on
his sleeve, "you would have been a better man if you
had known better women.  I am one that helped to
make you worse, because I never appealed to the good
in you.  There was only one of us who did the right
thing all through; and that was Bert.  He saved me
then, and to-day he has saved me again.  He has done
more for me this day than I could ever tell anybody.
Oh, Amurrica, we ought to be so ashamed of
ourselves&mdash;you and I!"
</p>

<p>
Amurrica, during this remarkable interview, had been
like one bereft of his usual faculties.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm d&mdash;d!" he said at last.  "What kind of
palaver's this?  Mestaer's playin' his own hand, same
as I am&mdash;him an' his bloomin' millions!  Thought I
didn't know him!  Thought he was safe, did he?  Bless
his kind heart, he'll find out that I'm goin' to get even
with him&mdash;if not one way, then another!"
</p>

<p>
A thought went like lightning through Millie's brain.
</p>

<p>
"Are you waiting here for him?"
</p>

<p>
They did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think he will come this way?"
</p>

<p>
"He went up there," said Arnie.
</p>

<p>
"Up there?  Up that hill?  He's not there now; I've
just come from there."
</p>

<p>
"Hist!" said Otis.
</p>

<p>
They all heard a footstep, clear in the night stillness,
swinging down the hill at a steady run.
</p>

<p>
"If it is he, Amurrica, now is your time to make it
up," urged Millie, and her heart began to beat faster,
and sweet, wild thoughts surged up within her at the
thought that she was hearkening her lover's approaching
feet.
</p>

<p>
"I'll make it up, no fear!" was the muttered reply, as
Otis, who was standing behind her, gripped her firmly
by both elbows, pinioning her in his strong hold, and
backing into the deepest shadow on the farther side of
the bridge, under the trees.  "Hold her!" he gasped to
Arnie; "hold tight, we've only a minute!"
</p>

<p>
The inky darkness, rendered blacker by contrast with
the white wash of moonlight on the road in front, held
the struggling group invisible.  Had Millie had an
inkling of her captor's plan she would have screamed,
but intent upon her peace-making desires, she still
wished to try gentle methods.  Before she realised his
intentions, Otis had rammed a handkerchief forcibly
against her mouth, and swiftly wound the feather boa
she wore round and round her head, forming a most
excellent impromptu gag.  He was reckless now, and
cared only for his revenge, consequences had faded out
of sight.  Millie, sensible in a flash of her own helplessness
and Bert's danger, fought with all her strength.
</p>

<p>
The light, firm steps came on fast.  They were round
the corner.  Hubert hastened in the moon's full radiance
to the darkness where the trap lay for him.  Just before
he reached the fatal spot, a sound came to the trained
ear of the scout&mdash;a muffled, indeterminate sound, which
was not running water, nor the sound of feet upon a
hard road.
</p>

<p>
Full in the light he stood, a brave target for a bullet;
and even as he paused, before he had drawn a breath,
there was the report of a revolver, a cry of some kind, a
sound of scuffling, a splashing as of someone wading
in water; and silence.
</p>

<p>
He stood bewildered.  The idea that somebody had
tried to shoot him never suggested itself.  He thought
it must be poachers, though the report did not sound
like a rifle shot, and there were no woods quite near.
He at once started to run on and see what had happened;
and at once tripped and fell, caught by the unseen wire.
</p>

<p>
Having fallen with some impetus, he came to the
ground heavily; and regained his feet with quite a new
impression of some danger imminent, though still he
never dreamed that the entanglement had been set for
him.  His heart flew to Melicent.  What of her?  She
must but a moment ago have passed the spot.  His first
action was to pull out matches and strike a light.
Holding the wax vesta low, he moved slowly forward;
and there, on the right hand, in the deep shadow, a
motionless form lay upon the ground.  A little
farther on, a bicycle stood against the wall.  Stooping
over the girl he saw that his fears were true.  It was
Melicent who lay there; and beside her, among the
grass, he stumbled upon a hard object, which proved to
be a revolver.  He pocketed this, and stretching out his
arms to her&mdash;"Millie!" he cried despairingly.  He
thought at first that she was lying on her face; and
experienced a shock of a quite peculiar kind of horror,
on finding her head wrapped about with choking
feathers.  He snatched her into his arms, raising her
from the ground; as he did so, a second revolver slipped
from her left hand, where she had grasped it, apparently
by the muzzle.  In the dark he could see nothing; and
there overswept him that maddening sense of helplessness
which is the worst thing a man can feel.  He bore her
out from the fatal shadow into the moonlight, laid her
upon the thymy turf, and with trembling fingers cut
away the brutal gag from her drawn face.  Then he
saw wet blood upon his sleeve, glistening in the light.
</p>

<p>
Was she dead?  That was the one question.  He
satisfied himself that she breathed, that her heart beat.
Whether the shot had entered her head or her body, he
could not say.  She was very still; was she dying
there, under his eyes, passive, unconscious of his
presence&mdash;of all the things there were to say, which must for
ever rest unsaid? ... His head was whirling.  Millie
gagged!  Millie shot!  By whom, and for what
conceivable reason?
</p>

<p>
The bleeding came from the left arm, which was
cruelly mangled, the flesh below the elbow being
actually singed by the shot.  The pistol must have gone
off while actually in her hand.  Mechanically he began
to slit away the white silk sleeve with his pocket-knife,
while he wondered dully what he should do, how best
help her.  If she were going to die, there were just two
things for him; to kill the man that killed her, and then
to blow out his own brains.  He thought she was growing
cold....
</p>

<p>
What could he do?  To leave her was impossible;
and they were far from help.  To carry her to Ilbersdale
Grange, or to carry her back up the hill to the Vicarage,
seemed equally impracticable.  As he turned the question
over in his mind, he heard a sound&mdash;a rustling, quite
near.  Turning his head, he looked straight into the
eyes of Arnie Lutwyche, who, dripping, had emerged
from the river under the bridge, and was creeping
towards him on hands and knees.
</p>

<p>
Quick as thought, Bert pulled out a revolver and
covered him.  The boy at once knelt up, raising his
hands.  His face wore a look of terror.
</p>

<p>
"Is she dead?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"So," said Bert, through his teeth; "what do you
know of this butchery?"
</p>

<p>
"It was Otis.  He was out after you.  She fought
with him, and got hold of the pistol," panted Arnie, in
his unaccustomed English.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe a word you say.  If Otis meant
murder he wouldn't have brought a witness along."
</p>

<p>
"There were two pistols," said Arnie, gulping down a
sob.  "Did you find the one I threw down?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;what of it?"
</p>

<p>
"There were to be two shots.  I was to swear you
fired first, and he only in self-defence.  Let me get you
some water, and tell me where to run for a doctor."
</p>

<p>
There was sense in this proposition, and after a
moment's rapid thought, Bert availed himself of it.
There was practically no doubt that Otis was off; he
wasted no time in questioning or upbraiding the boy.
Tearing a leaf from his pocket-book, he scrawled a note
to Helston, telling him what had happened, and asking
him to bring a conveyance of some kind at once, and to
send Arnie on for the doctor.  Meanwhile Arnie had
brought his straw hat full of water, and the moment he
received his instructions, set off running fast along the
road.
</p>

<p>
Bert was alone again with the girl.
</p>

<p>
There was a huge lump rising upon one side of her
forehead&mdash;he guessed it to be the result of a silencing
blow from a brutal fist.  Possibly it was merely the
effect of her fall to the ground.  This it was, he hoped,
which was rendering her unconscious.  He felt about
carefully among the long hair, and could find no trace
that a bullet had struck her head, nor was there any
mark upon the white silk blouse she wore.  He bathed
her forehead with her own little handkerchief; he knew
where to look for it, in her sleeve; he knew every little
habit which was hers.  For so long he had been garnering
up his deep knowledge of her&mdash;for this?  It was all
to be in vain?  The thing was so preposterous that he
laughed.
</p>

<p>
This white brow, over which he passed the cold
water, was his treasure-house.  That it could be empty
was a thing manifestly impossible.
</p>

<p>
Everything was quiet about them in the glorious
night A little wind shivered among the trees that
overhung the bridge.  He pulled off his coat, tucking it
carefully about her.  As he did so, she opened her eyes,
looking fully at him.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately she took in the whole situation,
and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You're safe," she said contentedly.
</p>

<p>
She was always wonderful; but this was the crowning
point of all the sensations she had ever given him.
Through the wild exultation that filled him, he, as
usual, thought first of her.  For her sake he must be
very calm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm all right," he said, in scorn of any idea of
danger to himself.  "But what about you?"
</p>

<p>
She smiled, a smile that lit up all her face and
danced in her eyes.  Directly he saw it, he knew she
could have no vital hurt.  The imp of mischief was
in it.
</p>

<p>
"Bert, I've done it," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Done what?" he asked uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
"Moved the mountain."
</p>

<p>
He began to think she was wandering.
</p>

<p>
"Have you really?" he asked, absorbed in the play
of her dimples in the moonlight, and realising that there
were possibilities in her smile that he had by no means
fully appreciated hitherto, connoisseur though he
believed himself to be.
</p>

<p>
"I think I know what happened," she said.  "I
wrestled for the revolver, and it went off.  I believe it
shot me!  I saw you come running, and stop short in
the road, and I couldn't scream because he had gagged
me....  Is that what happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;exactly."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," in tones of exultation&mdash;"well, then,
Captain Mestaer Brooke, I have saved your life!"
</p>

<p>
"At what cost, Millie?  At what cost?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you think about the cost when you saved mine?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that was such a different thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Why was it a different thing?"
</p>

<p>
"You know!  Because I loved you."
</p>

<p>
She closed the eyes into which he would persistently
gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "now that we are quits, now that
you too have a burden of gratitude to carry about, I
feel ever so much happier, or at least I should,
only&mdash;Hubert, you don't know how fearfully my arm hurts!"
</p>

<p>
"I know it must!  I can do so little for it until help
comes!  I daren't leave you here alone&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; don't!"
</p>

<p>
"What is the very nearest house?"
</p>

<p>
"A mile away at least.  Don't go!  I'll lie here till
someone finds us."
</p>

<p>
"You need not do that.  Arnie has taken a note to
Glen Royd."
</p>

<p>
"Arnie?  Oh, I am glad of that."  She closed her
eyes and panted.
</p>

<p>
"Will you let me try carrying you a little way?
Every step would bring us nearer to relief.  If it shakes
you, I could put you down.  May I try?"
</p>

<p>
"I am heavier than I was in Africa."
</p>

<p>
"I am stronger than I was in Africa&mdash;tough as
leather."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you always were strong!  But never mind.
We're quits now!  You can't stand there any more,
saying: 'Just look how you treat the man that saved
your life!'"
</p>

<p>
"Millie!  When have I ever said so?"
</p>

<p>
"You did&mdash;you did&mdash;you did!  You have never left
off saying it for one single minute for the last five years."
</p>

<p>
He broke into a laugh that was a little tremulous.
"Millie, what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know what I mean.  That has always
been the trouble, hasn't it?  You have always known
what I meant.  You knew, that day the water spouted
out.  I didn't.  It seemed so impertinent of you to
know more about me than I knew myself.  But
now ... I think it may be rather restful ... to think
you know the worst of me!  You know it all, you
see ... even about the scars on my back."
</p>

<p>
He made some kind of incoherent exclamation.  He
had always meant to succeed; but now that this
amazing success was his, he could not believe in it.
A wild idea came to him that his bliss, like the dread
sword of Damocles, was poised above his head by a
hair; that in an instant it might fall, and irretrievable
ruin would result.  He was too exalted to try to think
out how it had come about that this girl was his at last.
She was injured&mdash;he could not say how deeply; she
was in pain, and he was distracted with anxiety.  He
was unable to grasp the idea of happiness.  Afterwards,
when he looked back upon it, he believed that the
underlying idea of his mood was that of greatness.
All triviality seemed to be washed away from life, and
he trod the paths of a vast experience as the Greeks
trod the tragic stage, raised up on cothurns.  It was
best, he saw, that joy should come thus sublimated by
grief.  If it was to be transient, he should still have
had it.  He had lived indeed; he had seen the Vision
of the Grail.  Life was a sacrament henceforward.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am so thirsty!" gasped Melicent
</p>

<p>
He suddenly remembered that he carried in his
pocket the flask that he used when travelling.  There
was still a little wine and water left in it, and he poured
it out.  Seating himself beside her, he carefully drew
her up, propping her weight against him, and held the
cup to her lips.
</p>

<p>
When she had drunk, they sat on so, in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hall has been telling me how it has all been
my fault," she said, after a pause.  "He has told me
how vain and selfish I am, and how I take all and give
nothing.  Poor Lance!  I never gave him anything,
Bert&mdash;not even a kiss.  I did give you one, didn't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank God!"
</p>

<p>
To his amazement, she begun to bubble and murmur
with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Hall didn't know I was going to meet my
chance!  Oh, Bert, it's so wonderful!  I don't think
you quite realise that Otis meant to kill you!  He
did, really!  Don't you want to thank me for saving
your life so nicely?  Do thank me, just to make it
seem real!"
</p>

<p>
The chest that pillowed her head heaved mightily.
He forced an answer, but the effort broke him down.
</p>

<p>
"How could I thank you for saving mine ... if it
was at the expense of yours?"  He bent down his
cheek upon her hair, and sobbed helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not dead, Bert, dear," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"No; but you're in awful pain.  Do you think I
don't know?  I can see you are chatting on like this,
just to make me think you're not suffering!  I can't
bear it, Millie&mdash;I can't indeed!  I am going to carry
you a little way.  Put your other arm round my neck;
I'll raise you as slowly as I can.  There!  Did that
shake you?  I'll walk a few steps, and if the
discomfort's too great, you must tell me."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that, as he moved along, his soul
ran the gamut of all human emotion.  Death and Life
brushed sable and silver wings over him as he trod, and
the glowing rose of Love warmed and lighted all things
like the white heat of a furnace.  Clear before him lay
the picture of the former time when this very thing had
happened.  His memory of his feelings on that occasion
was tinged with pity and contempt.  What had he then
known, or understood, of Love or Life?
</p>

<p>
Now at last he knew the value of both.  The rapture
and the insecurity swayed him to and fro like the
motion of a pendulum.  He had the gravest apprehensions
about Melicent's injuries.  The shattered arm was
the same that had been dislocated five years before.  He
feared serious complications.
</p>

<p>
"Millie, Millie," he murmured, "is it very bad?"
</p>

<p>
Her face was pressed against his neck; he could hear
her gasping breath.  She gave a little moan, as if to
intimate that she heard, but could not answer.  After a
minute, she began to whisper, as though to herself:
</p>

<p>
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow, I
will fear no evil....  I will fear no evil, for thou art
with me....  Bert! ... Is the fish-pond full?"
</p>

<p>
He followed the rapid transition of her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Quite full, and the water as clear as glass.  The
lilies are planted already."
</p>

<p>
He had kept on a steady, slow pace for some time,
and was feeling rather done, when she whispered,
begging him to stop a little.  He chose a lump of
heathery turf, and sat down with her upon his knees,
cradling her as comfortably as he could.  So he had sat
in Africa!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that is good!  That is rest!" she sighed; and
after a pause&mdash;"Bert, you know I love you, don't
you?"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were wide open, searching his face.  For
a moment he forgot his devouring anxieties, and was
sensible only of the rapture.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," he answered solemnly, returning her
deep gaze.
</p>

<p>
"I loved you that day, of course; but truly, Bert,
I didn't know it.  I thought I did right to send you
away.  Oh, what a beast I was to you that night!  I
thought if I stood firm that once, it would be over, and
you would let me go.  But you never did.  Bert, if I am
going to die&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He clashed in harshly, in furious repudiation of the
idea.  "To die, you little fool?  You're not going to
die!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed weakly.  "Oh, Bert!  You'll never
improve, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't," he brought out, with anguish.  "I can't
say pretty names.  You're&mdash;so much more to me than
dear.  You're ... life itself!&mdash;my life!  How can you
be going to die?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I feel ... most strange: as if I were coming
away out of my body.  I feel as if I could float.  I
want&mdash;you know&mdash;'to swim in lucid shallows, just
eluding water-lily leaves.' ... The lilies are planted
already.  I keep wishing to be there, in the house; don't
you?"
</p>

<p>
He could not follow this.  "What house?" he asked
her gently.
</p>

<p>
"Lone Ash.  I should like to die there."
</p>

<p>
"You shall live there, Millie, please God!"
</p>

<p>
The words were a passionate appeal.  Stooping, he
gathered her to him, drawing her close, close against his
heart, and laid his lips on hers.  She answered his
kiss, and then he felt her limbs relax.  A blessed
unconsciousness had come to relieve her pain.
</p>

<p>
Far along the road he heard the distant beat, beat, of
approaching horse's feet.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Gwendolen Cooper sat with her parents in the
drawing-room of Fransdale Vicarage on an afternoon
in late October.  She had come home for a holiday,
and also to condole with her parents over the family
troubles.
</p>

<p>
Theo had gone to Australia, as Principal Boy, with
a Pantomime company.  Barbara, the fourth girl, the
quietest and most reserved of the family, had, on
her twenty-first birthday, announced her intention of
marrying Alfred Dow.
</p>

<p>
It was this second calamity which the Vicarage found
overwhelming.  A certain gloss might be artistically
cast over the doings of Theo in Australia.  Barbara's
doings in Fransdale must be proclaimed upon the
house-top; and should she persist in her intention, the
vicar felt that nothing remained for him but to exchange
livings and depart from the scene of his humiliation.
</p>

<p>
To be openly defied and set at naught by the
smallest and most silent of his daughters, was a blow
he had not anticipated; as indeed he had wholly failed
to anticipate in the smallest degree any of his children's
undutifulness.  His jet-black hair was silvering fast,
his mien colder and more severe than ever.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper was growing very stout, and already
somewhat infirm.  Recent events had chafed the surface
of her smiling cheerfulness a little.  Her company smile
was now wont to come off at times.  But her own belief
in her own exemplary rectitude was as unshaken as ever.
</p>

<p>
"We have nothing to reproach ourselves with, and
that is such a comfort," she remarked to her newly
arrived daughter.  "It was our duty to offer poor dear
Melicent a home, and we did so.  In the space of three
weeks she corrupted the entire family; and we still
feel the effects of her deceit.  Had it not been for her,
Alfred Dow would never have forgotten his place in
the way he has persistently done of late years.  But
really, if one's religious beliefs were not too firm to be
shaken, it would put them to the test, to think that,
after being publicly exposed in the way she was here,
in Fransdale this summer, she is now to marry a
millionaire."
</p>

<p>
"Well," observed Gwendolen drily, "I understand
that Captain Brooke knows the worst of her, so I
suppose that is all right."
</p>

<p>
"But think of his past life, my dear&mdash;the son of a
poor ignorant Boer farmer&mdash;another Alfred Dow, only
worse!  And, with his money, his wife and he will be
in the county set, while we, in consequence of Barbara's
conduct, will have to hide our heads in disgrace."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see any disgrace in marrying Alfred Dow,"
bluntly observed Madeline, who was also present.
</p>

<p>
"With our position and family connections&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That does seem such tommy-rot, mother.  We
couldn't all five have married Lance Burmester, even
if he had wanted to marry one of us, which, of course, he
never did.  And he's the only man we were allowed to
think about as a <i>parti</i>.  Except for Gwendolen's affair
with Freshfield&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oblige me by not slandering your sister," cut in the
vicar.
</p>

<p>
"Tommy-rot again, father," calmly said Gwendolen,
who laughed.  "You know, mother knows, I know, how
near we were then to a scandal of the most serious
kind.  I wonder how many girls in the world would
have held their tongue about that as Millie has, after
the way we girls let her in!  What liars she thought
us!  I say, let Barbara marry a good man if she likes,
and live the life she likes.  I would have married Alfred
Dow like a shot if he had asked me.  Far better than
slaving away as I do, teaching other people's children."
</p>

<p>
The vicar, in wrath, said something about the dignity
of teaching.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; if you have brains or education," retorted
Gwendolen coolly.  "I have neither.  I am only fit
to be a farmer's wife."
</p>

<p>
"Your mother had no more," began the vicar, in his
most weighty tones.
</p>

<p>
"Please let's leave mother out of the discussion,"
hastily said Gwendolen, rising and going to the window.
"I might say something I should be sorry for.  Here
comes Bee."
</p>

<p>
Beatrice came in hastily.
</p>

<p>
"I met Sybil Ayres," said she, "and heard quite a lot
of things.  Sybil and the General went to London last
week, and they called on the Helstons, and got all the
news.  First of all, Melicent is to be married in London,
next week, very, very quietly.  The Bishop of Pretoria
is staying in England just to perform the ceremony, and
sails the next day.  They are going for a few weeks'
honeymoon, and then into rooms at Clunbury, to superintend
the finishing of their house.  Melicent is not strong
yet.  They are quite sure now that the arm need not be
amputated, but she will never have quite the proper use
of it.  No bridesmaids or anything at the wedding,
because of Lance Burmester's feelings."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Madeline, "I'm hanged if I'd marry a
millionaire and have no bridesmaids!"
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think?  They've had a letter
from Major Otis, from the United States, saying he's
sorry."
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried the vicar.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Mr. Helston told the General more about it all
than has ever been allowed to leak out.  The General
has had such an enthusiastic admiration for Captain
Brooke, ever since the Fransdale sports, so I suppose
they knew he would be interested....  It appears that,
after what happened that day at the sports, Melicent
thought it right to break her engagement.  They say
she had known in her heart for a long time that it was
a mistake, but did not like to say so, but I suppose after
what had been said about her family, and so on, she
thought if she did not break it off, the Burmesters
would, so she wrote to Lance, and then, feeling very
low in her mind, she went off to confess her sins to
Mr. Hall."
</p>

<p>
Madeline giggled.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy confessing one's sins to you, father!" she said.
"Our only idea in old days used to be to hide ours,
wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Her father ignored the impertinence.  "Proceed,
Beatrice," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Major Otis and the boy were lying in wait for
Captain Brooke by the Ilba Bridge; and Millie saw
them, and as far as I could gather, she spoke to Otis,
and asked him to reform; and then she suddenly got to
know that they were waiting for the Captain, and they
gagged her to prevent her crying out, and she fought
like a demon, and the pistol went off and shot her right
along the arm, from below the elbow right up to the
shoulder&mdash;she had hold of the muzzle, you see&mdash;and
then Otis was scared and bolted.  But Arnie Lutwyche
went and got help.  And they wouldn't have Otis
searched for....  They let him go, and as you know, tried
to say it was a poaching affair, only everybody knew
better.  And now he has written this letter, saying that
ever since, the things Millie said that night have been
ringing in his head, and he's going to have a try to run
straight."
</p>

<p>
"Beatrice, your slang!" said her father hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm quoting the dear Major.  I did like that
man!  Just my style, down to the ground!  I think I'll
go to the States and look him up.  Twice as amusing
as Captain Brooke!  He's a regular stuck-pig!  How
hard we all tried to fascinate him!  You might as well
have tried to fascinate one of the Three Howes!  He'll
bore poor Millie to death, but he seems free with his
money.  He is doing a lot for that hideous Boer
Lutwyche boy."
</p>

<p>
"How they must all have laughed in their sleeves
next morning at you, mother, when you solemnly went
up to Glen Royd with your mysterious secret about
Captain Brooke!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Cooper grew very pink.  The remembrance was
among her least happy reminiscences.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrice darling, ring for tea," she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Sybil saw him, when she was up in town," pursued
Beatrice, as she obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Saw whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Brooke.  She saw him and Melicent
together.  She said you would hardly have known him,
he seemed so gay and lively.  She said she had never
thought Melicent pretty before."
</p>

<p>
"Sybil wasn't likely to think so, as long as Melicent
was engaged to Lance," remarked Madeline caustically.
</p>

<p>
The maid brought in tea.
</p>

<p>
"Ingleby's been down to town and brought up a
letter," said she.  "Its for Miss Barbie."
</p>

<p>
"For Barbie?"  Gwendolen snatched it.  "It's from
Millie," she said.  "I'll go and call her."
</p>

<p>
Barbara presently came in.  Her eyelids were rimmed
with pink, for she had done a good deal of weeping
lately.  But her aspect was determined.  Gwendolen
was only just home, and she feared more brow-beating,
but was evidently prepared to face it.  In expression
and colouring, she was not unlike Melicent on a larger
scale.
</p>

<p>
"A letter for you, Babs," said her elder sister kindly.
</p>

<p>
Barbara looked surprised; she had no correspondents.
She opened her letter, and Gwendolen read it aloud
over her shoulder.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"MY DEAR BARBARA,&mdash;I am writing to tell you that
Hubert and I have just heard from Mr. Dow of his
engagement to you.  He says that Uncle Edmund and
Aunt Minna are not pleased, which we are sorry to hear,
as we both think Mr. Dow a man in a thousand.  We
hope that any difficulties may soon be overcome.
Mr. Dow has been having long talks with Mr. Hall, and I
believe the religious barrier can be removed.  He loves
you deeply, I feel sure, and that is the great thing.  As
long as you know he loves you, you can be content to
bear things.
</p>

<p>
"We want you to accept this cheque for £500 as our
wedding present, and as soon as Lone Ash is ready, you
must both come and stay with us.
</p>

<p>
"Hubert is as fond of Fransdale as I am, and we
shall always be there some part of the year, so we shall
see a good deal of each other in the future, I hope.
</p>

<p>
"Hubert wants Uncle Edmund to know that he
wishes to give a sum of £500 to each of you girls on her
wedding, as a small acknowledgment of his goodness in
offering to take charge of me when I was left alone.&mdash;I
remain, your affectionate cousin,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MELICENT LUTWYCHE."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Gwendolen rose from her seat as the letter was
concluded.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "I always knew Millie was worth the
lot of us.  I shouldn't wonder if she asks you to Lone
Ash, girls, and gives you a good time.  She doesn't
bear malice, as I should in her place.  We were brought
up on scruples, not principles.  We were urged to a
certain course of conduct, not because it was right, but
because it was the proper thing.  Conventions were to
us instead of Commandments.  Here is Barbara,
wanting to do a thing which at worst is only a social
blunder, and she is treated as if she wanted her
neighbour's husband.  I'm on your side, Babs; you
may count on me."
</p>

<p>
The vicar and his wife found themselves, as usual, in
a minority of two.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Two or three years after these events, the Bishop
of Pretoria told the outlines of the story of Hubert and
Melicent to a lady for whom he had a great respect.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished, she asked, in dissatisfied tones,
whether the marriage had turned out a happy one?
</p>

<p>
He replied that it was completely happy; almost
ideally so.
</p>

<p>
"You ask as though the story had not pleased you,"
he added, in tones of disappointment.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"To tell you the truth, it does not.  I can never give
my unqualified approval to any story in which it was
the man who won."
</p>

<p>
"You forget," he corrected her, "or perhaps I should
say, you fail to grasp the essential point Hubert could
never have won Melicent, had it not been that first of all
Melicent won him.  Love is like that spiritual life to
which it is so closely akin; who conquers there, does so
by virtue of being himself defeated."
